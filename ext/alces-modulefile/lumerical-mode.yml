:description: |
  Supporting an eigenmode solver as well as various methods for
  simulating guided propagation of optical fields over long distances,
  MODE Solutions is an ideal tool for the design, analysis and
  optimization of guided components. The eigenmode solver accurately
  calculates the physical properties of guided modes in truly
  arbitrary waveguide geometries. The 2.5D varFDTD solver in MODE
  Solutions enables rapid and accurate simulation of planar waveguide
  geometries such as SOI tapers and ring resonators, whereas the
  eigenmode expansion (EME) solver is ideal for simulating long
  distance light propagation in waveguide devices such as spot-size
  converters, tapers and Bragg gratings.

  When combined with DEVICE, Lumerical's optoelectronic solver, MODE
  Solutions provides a powerful tool for the design and analysis of
  active components such as high speed optoelectronic modulators.

  Along with FDTD Solutions, INTERCONNECT and DEVICE, MODE Solutions
  is a key part of Lumerical's comprehensive photonic design and
  analysis tools. All of Lumerical's solvers provide support for data
  import/export and integration into common EDA tools, enabling
  complete product design flows from component architecture and
  optimization to large scale device and system design.
