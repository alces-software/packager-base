:description: |
  The Oasys Suite of software, exclusively written for LS-DYNA, is at
  the leading edge of the pre- and post-processing markets and is used
  worldwide by many of the largest LS-DYNA customers.

  The Oasys Suite provides the user with tools and functions to reduce
  the amount of time needed to build and check a LS-DYNA model,
  allowing the engineer to concentrate more on the actual problem in
  hand rather than just the task getting a model up and running in
  LS-DYNA.
