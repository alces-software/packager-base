:summary: Software suite for modeling macromolecular structures
:url: http://www.rosettacommons.org/
:description: |
  Rosetta is the premier software suite for modeling macromolecular
  structures. As a flexible, multi-purpose application, it includes
  tools for structure prediction, design, and remodeling of proteins
  and nucleic acids. Since 1998, Rosetta web servers have run billions
  of structure prediction and protein design simulations.

  Researchers use Rosetta to better understand treatments of
  infectious diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Further
  applications involve the development of vaccines, new materials,
  targeted protein binders, and enzyme design.

# alces-modulefile 'compiler' parameter only supports 'bin' and
# 'noarch' atm, so stick with 'bin' for this, even though it must be
