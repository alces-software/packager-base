:description: |
  The electromagnetic simulation software CST STUDIO SUITE is the
  culmination of many years of research and development into the most
  accurate and efficient computational solutions for electromagnetic
  designs. It comprises CSTâ€™s tools for the design and optimization of
  devices operating in a wide range of frequencies - static to
  optical. Analyses may include thermal and mechanical effects, as
  well as circuit simulation.

  CST STUDIO SUITE benefits from an integrated design environment
  which gives access to the entire range of solver technology. System
  assembly and modeling facilitates multi-physics and co-simulation as
  well as the management of entire electromagnetic systems.

  CST STUDIO SUITE can offer considerable product to market advantages
  such as shorter development cycles, virtual prototyping before
  physical trials, and optimization instead of experimentation.
