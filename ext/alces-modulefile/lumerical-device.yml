:description: |
  DEVICE employs the industry proven drift-diffusion equations to
  model steady state and transient behavior of charge carriers in
  semiconductors. Using advanced finite-element mesh generation
  algorithms, DEVICE is capable of efficiently handling arbitrary
  geometries, enabling accurate modeling of innovative integrated
  optoelectronic designs.

  DEVICE provides users with a complete set of tools to design and
  evaluate semiconductors, including integrated process simulation,
  comprehensive physical material models and robust numerical
  algorithms for device simulation.

  When combined with MODE Solutions, Lumerical's waveguide design
  environment, DEVICE provides a powerful tool for the design and
  analysis of active components such as high speed optoelectronic
  modulators.

  Along with FDTD Solutions, MODE Solutions, and INTERCONNECT, DEVICE
  is a key part of Lumerical's comprehensive photonic design and
  analysis tools. All of Lumerical's solvers provide support for data
  import/export and integration into common EDA tools, enabling
  complete product design flows from component architecture and
  optimization to large scale device and system design.
