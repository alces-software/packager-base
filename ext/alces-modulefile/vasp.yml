:description: |
  The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for 
  atomic scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations 
  and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.

  VASP computes an approximate solution to the many-body Schrödinger 
  equation, either within density functional theory (DFT), solving the 
  Kohn-Sham equations, or within the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation, 
  solving the Roothaan equations. Hybrid functionals that mix the 
  Hartree-Fock approach with density functional theory are implemented as 
  well. Furthermore, Green's functions methods (GW quasiparticles, and 
  ACFDT-RPA) and many-body perturbation theory (2nd-order Møller-Plesset) 
  are available in VASP.
