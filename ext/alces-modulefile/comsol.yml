:description: |
  COMSOL Multiphysics is a general-purpose software platform, based
  on advanced numerical methods, for modeling and simulating
  physics-based problems. With COMSOL Multiphysics, you will be able
  to account for coupled or multiphysics phenomena. With more than 30
  add-on products to choose from, you can further expand the
  simulation platform with dedicated physics interfaces and tools for
  electrical, mechanical, fluid flow, and chemical
  applications. Additional interfacing products connect your COMSOL
  Multiphysics simulations with technical computing, CAD, and ECAD
  software.
