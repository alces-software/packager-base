:description: |
  Sonnet's suites of high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) Software are
  aimed at today's demanding design challenges involving predominantly
  planar (3D planar) circuits and antennas. Predominantly planar
  circuits include microstrip, stripline, coplanar waveguide, PCB
  (single and multiple layers) and combinations with vias, vertical
  metal sheets (z-directed strips), and any number of layers of metal
  traces embedded in stratified dielectric material.

  The Sonnet(R) Suites(TM) develop precise RF models (S-, Y-,
  Z-parameters or extracted SPICE model) for planar circuits and
  antennas. The software requires a physical description of your
  circuit (arbitrary layout and material properties for metal and
  dielectrics), and employs a rigorous Method-of-Moments EM analysis
  based on Maxwell's equations that includes all parasitic,
  cross-coupling, enclosure and package resonance effects.

  Sonnet maintains a single, dedicated focus on providing the
  industry's most accurate and reliable high frequency planar EM
  software. Our aim is to make it easy for our customers to either
  develop and analyze designs within our software, or to incorporate
  our tools into their existing design processes and
  frameworks. Customers need never commit to a proprietary framework
  in order to get the best in planar EM analysis.
