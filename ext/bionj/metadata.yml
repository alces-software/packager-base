:summary: An improved version of the NJ algorithm based on a simple model of sequence data
:url: http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/bionj/
:description: |
  A distance based phylogeny reconstruction algorithm. BIONJ is well
  suited for distances estimated from DNA or protein sequences. BIONJ
  has better topological accuracy than NJ in all evolutionary
  conditions; its superiority becomes important when the substitution
  rates are high and varying among lineages. However, BIONJ and NJ
  trees are often close or identical, notably when the number of taxa
  is low. BIONJ retains the speed of NJ and can be applied to very
  large data sets (> 1000 taxa). BIONJ can be run on several matrices
  to build bootstrap trees. As usual, distances should be corrected,
  e.g. using DNADIST or PROTDIST from PHYLIP.
