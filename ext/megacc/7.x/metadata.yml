:description: |
  Genome sequencing is generating vast amounts of DNA sequence data
  from a wide range of organisms. As a result, gene sequence databases
  are growing rapidly. In order to conduct efficient analyses of these
  data, there is a need for easy-to-use computer programs, containing
  fast computational algorithms and useful statistical methods.
  
  The objective of the MEGA software has been to provide tools for
  exploring, discovering, and analyzing DNA and protein sequences from
  an evolutionary perspective. The first version was developed for the
  limited computational resources that were available on the average
  personal computer in early 1990s. MEGA1 made many methods of
  evolutionary analysis easily accessible to the scientific community
  for research and education.

  MEGA7 is a major refactoring of the MEGA source code and achieves
  another leap forward in terms of performance. MEGA is now optimized
  for 64-bit processor architectures and can now utilize many GB of
  memory. In addition, the Tree Explorer window has been re-factored
  to handle trees with > 100k taxa (previously it could only handle
  ~4k taxa), depending on the available graphics processing
  resources. Beyond increased performance, improvements have been made
  to the user interface.
