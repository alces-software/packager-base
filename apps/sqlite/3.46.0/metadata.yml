:description: |
  SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained,
  serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database
  engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free
  for use for any purpose, commercial or private. SQLite is the most
  widely deployed database in the world with more applications than we
  can count, including several high-profile projects.

  SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL
  databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite
  reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL
  database with multiple tables, indices, triggers, and views, is
  contained in a single disk file. The database file format is
  cross-platform - you can freely copy a database between 32-bit and
  64-bit systems or between big-endian and little-endian
  architectures. These features make SQLite a popular choice as an
  Application File Format. SQLite database files are a recommended
  storage format by the US Library of Congress. Think of SQLite not as
  a replacement for Oracle but as a replacement for fopen()
