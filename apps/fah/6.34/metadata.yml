:summary: A distributed computing project studying protein folding and misfolding
:url: http://folding.stanford.edu
:description: |
  Folding@home is a distributed computing project which studies
  protein folding, misfolding, aggregation, and related diseases. We
  use novel computational methods and large scale distributed
  computing, to simulate timescales thousands to millions of times
  longer than previously achieved. This has allowed us to simulate
  folding for the first time, and to now direct our approach to
  examine folding related disease.

  This package contains client software allowing your system to
  participate in the Folding@Home project.
