:summary: Software for clustering de novo assembled transcripts and counting overlapping reads
:url: https://code.google.com/p/corset-project/
:description: |
  Corset is a command-line software program to go from a de novo
  transcriptome assembly to gene-level counts. Our software takes a
  set of reads that have been multi-mapped to the transcriptome
  (where multiple alignments per read were reported) and
  hierarchically clusters the transcripts based on the proportion of
  shared reads and expression patterns. It will report the clusters
  and gene-level counts for each sample, which are easily tested for
  differential expression with count based tools such as edgeR and
  DESeq.
