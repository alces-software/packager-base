:summary: Quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq data 
:url: https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto 
:description: |
  kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from RNA-Seq 
  data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing 
  reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly 
  determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for 
  alignment. On benchmarks with standard RNA-Seq data, kallisto can quantify 30 
  million human reads in less than 3 minutes on a Mac desktop computer using 
  only the read sequences and a transcriptome index that itself takes less than 
  10 minutes to build. Pseudoalignment of reads preserves the key information 
  needed for quantification, and kallisto is therefore not only fast, but also 
  as accurate than existing quantification tools. In fact, because the 
  pseudoalignment procedure is robust to errors in the reads, in many benchmarks 
  kallisto significantly outperforms existing tools.
