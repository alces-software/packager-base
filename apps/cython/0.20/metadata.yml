:description: |
  Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python
  language as easy as Python itself. It is based on the well-known
  Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge functionality and
  optimizations.

  Cython gives you the combined power of Python and C to let you:

    * write Python code that calls back and forth from and to C or C++
      code natively at any point
    * easily tune readable Python code into plain C performance by
      adding static type declarations
    * use combined source code level debugging to find bugs in your
      Python, Cython and C code
    * interact efficiently with large data sets, e.g. using
      multi-dimensional NumPy arrays
    * quickly build your applications within the large, mature and
      widely used CPython ecosystem
    * integrate natively with existing code and data from legacy,
      low-level or high-performance libraries and applications
