# fastqc(7) -- FastQC v0.11.3 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control
checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing
pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use
to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of
which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are:

  * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
  * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may
    be problems
  * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
  * Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
  * Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports
    without running the interactive application
