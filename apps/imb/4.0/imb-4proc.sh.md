# imb-4proc(7) -- IMB v4.0 - 4 processes (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

IMB is a networking benchmark tool.

The IntelÂ® MPI Benchmarks perform a set of MPI performance measurements
for point-to-point and global communication operations for a range of
message sizes. The generated benchmark data fully characterizes:

  * Performance of a cluster system, including node performance,
    network latency, and throughput
  * Efficiency of the MPI implementation used

For more information on running the IMB benchmark, please visit:
