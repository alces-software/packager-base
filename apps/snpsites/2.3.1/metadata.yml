:description: |
  Rapidly decreasing genome sequencing costs have led to a proportionate increase 
  in the number of samples used in prokaryotic population studies. Extracting 
  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a large whole genome alignment is 
  now a routine task, but existing tools have failed to scale efficiently with 
  the increased size of studies. These tools are slow, memory inefficient and are 
  installed through non-standard procedures. We present SNP-sites which can 
  rapidly extract SNPs from a multi-FASTA alignment using modest resources and can 
  output results in multiple formats for downstream analysis. SNPs can be extracted 
  from a 8.3 GB alignment file (1,842 taxa, 22,618 sites) in 267 seconds using 59 
  MB of RAM and 1 CPU core, making it feasible to run on modest computers. SNP-sites 
  is implemented in C and is available under the open source license GNU GPL version 3.
