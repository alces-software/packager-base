:description: |
  Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express
  common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe
  way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and
  functional languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more
  productive. Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to
  three when compared to an equivalent Java application.
  
  Many existing companies who depend on Java for business critical
  applications are turning to Scala to boost their development
  productivity, applications scalability and overall reliability.
