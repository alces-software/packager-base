# oases(7) -- Oases v0.2.08 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Oases is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed to produce
transcripts from short read sequencing technologies, such as
Illumina, SOLiD, or 454 in the absence of any genomic assembly. It
was developed by Marcel Schulz (MPI for Molecular Genomics) and
Daniel Zerbino (previously at the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EMBL-EBI), now at UC Santa Cruz).

Oases uploads a preliminary assembly produced by Velvet, and
clusters the contigs into small groups, called loci. It then
exploits the paired-end read and long read information, when
available, to construct transcript isoforms.
