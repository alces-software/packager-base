:description: |
  CTFFIND3 and CTFTILT are two programs for finding CTFs of electron
  micrographs. The program CTFFIND3 is an updated version of the
  program CTFFIND2, which was developed in 1998 by Nikolaus Grigorieff
  at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK with
  financial support from the MRC. This software is licensed under the

  CTFFIND and CTFTILT determine defocus parameters from images of
  untilted specimens, as well as defocus and tilt parameters from
  images of tilted specimens, respectively. Both programs use a simple
  algorithm that fits the amplitude modulations visible in a power
  spectrum with a calculated contrast transfer function (CTF). The
  background present in the power spectrum is calculated using a
  low-pass filter. The background is then subtracted from the original
  power spectrum, allowing the fitting of only the oscillatory
  component of the CTF.  CTFTILT determines specimen tilt parameters
  by measuring the defocus at a series of locations on the image while
  constraining them to a single plane.
