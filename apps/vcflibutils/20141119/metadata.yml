:description: |
  The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual
  format intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations
  between individuals. VCF provides a common interchange format for
  the description of variation in individuals and populations of
  samples, and has become the defacto standard reporting format for a
  wide array of genomic variant detectors.

  vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence
  variation as it can be described by VCF. It is both:

    * an API for parsing and operating on records of genomic variation
      as it can be described by the VCF format,
    * and a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex
      manipulations on VCF files.

  The API itself provides a quick and extremely permissive method to
  read and write VCF files. Extensions and applications of the library
  provided in the included utilities (*.cpp) comprise the vast bulk of
  the library's utility for most users.

  This package comprises the command-line utilities.
