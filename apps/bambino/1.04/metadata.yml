:summary: Variant detector and alignment viewer for next-generation sequencing data in the SAM/BAM format
:url: https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/goldenPath/bamview/documentation/index.html
:description: |
  Bambino is a graphical viewer and variant detector for
  next-generation sequencing files in SAM/BAM format. Its primary
  features:

    * detects SNPs, insertions, and deletions directly from BAM files
      using a configurable process. This may be run from the command
      line (see BAM utilities documentation) or interactively from
      within the viewer.
    * can dynamically pool data from multiple BAM files: view and
      analyze data from tumor/normal pairs, multiple runs, or even
      platforms. The variant detector takes advantage of pooling as
      well, producing output suitable for somatic m utation detection.
    * Reconciles all indels in the dataset into a unified, padded
      alignment with the reference sequence, padding the reads and the
      reference as necessary. While the SAM/BAM specification allows
      for padded alignments, most BAM files contain unpadded
      read-mapping data. Bambino essentially converts these unpadded
      alignments into padded ones. This postprocessing provides a
      complete and unified view of the assembly, even of reads having
      different indel sizes at the same location. This is useful for
      visualizing features such as STRPs, and debugging the alignments
      produced by read-mapping programs.
    * displays mappings of dbSNP SNP sites and reference protein
      sequences, using UCSC genome annotations. The database
      connection is configurable; it can load features from various
      databases and/or genome builds, and can use the UCSC public
      MySQL database server or a local mirror you provide.
    * calculates protein coding changes caused by SNPs in NCBI RefSeqs
    * can display reads against finished reference sequence (currently
      samtools-indexed FASTA, UCSC .2bit and .nib formats are
      supported), or a consensus generated from the source .bam data
