:summary: A short read de novo assembly tool
:url: http://soap.genomics.org.cn/
:description: |
  SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de
  novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is
  specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates
  new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out
  accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.

  SOAPdenovo aims for large plant and animal genomes, although it also
  works well on bacteria and fungi genomes. It runs on 64-bit/32-bit
  Linux/MAC OS systems with a minimum of 5G physical memory. For big
  genomes like human, about 150 GB memory would be required.
