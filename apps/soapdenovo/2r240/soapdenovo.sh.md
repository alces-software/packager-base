# soapdenovo(7) -- SOAPdenovo v2r240 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de
novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is
specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates
new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out
accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.

SOAPdenovo aims for large plant and animal genomes, although it also
works well on bacteria and fungi genomes. It runs on 64-bit/32-bit
Linux/MAC OS systems with a minimum of 5G physical memory. For big
genomes like human, about 150 GB memory would be required.
