  Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS), a novel algorithm for short
  reads sequencers such as Genome Analyzer (Illumina / Solexa).

  Next generation parallel sequencing technologies made chromatin
  immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) a popular
  strategy to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, while
  creating challenges for analysis algorithms. 

  MACS empirically models the length of the sequenced ChIP fragments,
  which tends to be shorter than sonication or library construction
  size estimates, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of
  predicted binding sites. MACS also uses a dynamic Poisson
  distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome
  sequence, allowing for more sensitive and robust prediction. MACS
  compares favorably to existing ChIP-Seq peak-finding algorithms, is
  publicly available open source, and can be used for ChIP-Seq with or
  without control samples.
