:summary: Differential analysis for ChIP-seq with biological replicates
:url: https://github.com/shenlab-sinai/diffreps
:description: |
  ChIP-seq is now widely used to profile the protein DNA interactions
  on a genome. It is of high interest to compare the differential
  enrichment of a histone mark or transcription factor between two
  contrasting conditions, such as disease vs. control. diffReps is
  developed to serve this purpose. It scans the whole genome using a
  sliding window, performing millions of statistical tests and report
  the significant hits. diffReps takes into account the biological
  variations within a group of samples and uses that information to
  enhance the statistical power. Considering biological variation is
  of high importance, especially for in vivo brain tissues.

  In addition, diffReps has two easy-to-use tools. One is for quick
  genomic annotation of a differential site or peak list. Another is
  for finding chromatin modification hotspots (see below). diffReps is
  developed as an automated pipeline so that everything can be done in
  one command. In incorporates four different statistical tests,
  i.e. negative binomial, T-test, G-test and Chi-square test, for
  differential analysis. So no matter you have biological replicates
  or not, you can choose an appropriate test for your purpose.
