:description: |
  Utilities for NGS and genomics-related bioinformatics developed
  within the Bioinformatics Core Facility (BCF) within the Faculty of
  Life Sciences (FLS) at the University of Manchester (UoM).

  The utilities are divided into broad categories:

   * Handling data from SOLiD and Illumina sequencers (solid2cluster,
     illumina2cluster)
   * Performing QC and manipulation of NGS data (QC-pipeline)
   * Setting up reference data (build-indexes)
   * Supporting analysis of ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and microarray data
     (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, microarray, NGS-general)
   * General non-bioinformatics utilities (utils)

  There is also a Python package called bcftbx which is used by many
  of the programs, and which provides a wide range of utility
  functions.
