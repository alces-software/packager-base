:url: http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Research/tau/home.php
:description: |
  TAU Performance SystemÂ® is a portable profiling and tracing toolkit
  for performance analysis of parallel programs written in Fortran, C,
  C++, Java, Python.

  TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) is capable of gathering
  performance information through instrumentation of functions,
  methods, basic blocks, and statements. All C++ language features are
  supported including templates and namespaces. The API also provides
  selection of profiling groups for organizing and controlling
  instrumentation. The instrumentation can be inserted in the source
  code using an automatic instrumentor tool based on the Program
  Database Toolkit (PDT), dynamically using DyninstAPI, at runtime in
  the Java Virtual Machine, or manually using the instrumentation API.
