:description: |
  Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of Open-Source computer codes for 
  electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale.
  It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.

  Quantum ESPRESSO has evolved into a distribution of independent and 
  inter-operable codes in the spirit of an open-source project. The Quantum 
  ESPRESSO distribution consists of a “historical” core set of components, 
  and a set of plug-ins that perform more advanced tasks, plus a number of 
  third-party packages designed to be inter-operable with the core 
  components. Researchers active in the field of electronic-structure 
  calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing 
  their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.
