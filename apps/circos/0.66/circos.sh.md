# circos(7) -- Circos v0.66 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Circos is a software package for visualizing data and information.
It visualizes data in a circular layout — this makes Circos ideal
for exploring relationships between objects or positions. There are
other reasons why a circular layout is advantageous, not the least
being the fact that it is attractive.

Circos is ideal for creating publication-quality infographics and
illustrations with a high data-to-ink ratio, richly layered data and
pleasant symmetries. You have fine control each element in the
figure to tailor its focus points and detail to your audience.

Circos is flexible. Although originally designed for visualizing
genomic data, it can create figures from data in any field—from
genomics to visualizing migration to mathematical art. If you have
data that describes relationships or multi-layered annotations of
one or more scales, Circos is for you.

Circos can be automated. It is controlled by plain-text
configuration files, which makes it easily incorporated into data
acquisition, analysis and reporting pipelines (a data pipeline is a
multi-step process in which data is analyzed by multiple and
typically independent tools, each passing their output as the input
to the next step).
