:summary: Allows sequences to be scanned against InterPro's signatures

:description: |
  InterPro is a database which integrates together predictive
  information about proteins' function from a number of partner
  resources, giving an overview of the families that a protein
  belongs to and the domains and sites it contains.

  Users who have novel nucleotide or protein sequences that they
  wish to functionally characterise can use the software package
  InterProScan to run the scanning algorithms from the InterPro
  database in an integrated way. Sequences are submitted in FASTA
  format. Matches are then calculated against all of the required
  member database's signatures and the results are then output in a
  variety of formats.
