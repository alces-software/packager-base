:description: |
  SOAPsplice is a tool for genome-wide ab initio detection of splice
  junction sites from RNA-Seq, a method using new generation
  sequencing technologies to sequence the messenger RNA. The tool
  performs better than the previous tools by detecting similar number
  of true junctions with lower false positives as the best performing
  tool in all different situations with different read lengths and
  coverage. In particular, SOAPsplice performs better by predicting
  more true junctions with low false positive rate when the coverage
  is low, which is useful for detecting the junctions for those mRNAs
  with relatively lower expression level.
