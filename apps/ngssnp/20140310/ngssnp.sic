This file is not used to build NGS-SNP but is required as packager requires a source file.

In the case of NGS-SNP, we are unable to retrieve the upstream ZIP
file without additional parameters to wget (as the wget user agent is
blocked by the upstream web server).  The download is manually handled
as part of the compilation phase within the package metadata.
