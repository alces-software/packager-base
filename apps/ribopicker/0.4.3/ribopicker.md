# ribopicker(7) -- riboPicker v0.4.3 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

The majority of RNA recovered in metatranscriptomic studies is ribosomal RNA
(rRNA), not mRNA, often exceeding 90% of the total reads (Stewart et al.,
2010; doi:10.1038/ismej.2010.18). Even after various treatments prior to
sequencing, the observed rRNA content decreases only slightly (Hei et al.,
2010; doi:10.1038/nmeth.1507). It is estimated that misannotations of rRNA
as proteins may cause up to 90% false positive matches of rRNA-like
sequences in metatranscriptomic studies (Tripp et al., 2011;
doi:10.1093/nar/gkr576). Those false positive matches are a serious concern
for downstream analysis, possibly causing erroneous conclusions. Therefore,
the removal of rRNA-like sequences presents a necessary step for all
metatranscriptomic projects.
