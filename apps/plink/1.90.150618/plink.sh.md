# plink(7) -- PLINK v1.90.150618 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis
toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses
in a computationally efficient manner.  The focus of PLINK is purely
on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for
steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating
genotype or CNV calls from raw data). Through integration with
gPLINK and Haploview, there is some support for the subsequent
visualization, annotation and storage of results.
