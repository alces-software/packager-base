:description: |
  PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis
  toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses
  in a computationally efficient manner.  The focus of PLINK is purely
  on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for
  steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating
  genotype or CNV calls from raw data). Through integration with
  gPLINK and Haploview, there is some support for the subsequent
  visualization, annotation and storage of results.
