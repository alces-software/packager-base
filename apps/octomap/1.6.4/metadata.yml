:summary: A probabilistic, flexible, and compact 3D mapping library for robotic systems

:description: |
  The OctoMap library implements a 3D occupancy grid mapping
  approach. It provides data structures and mapping algorithms. The
  map is implemented using an Octree. It is designed to meet the
  following requirements:

    * Full 3D model. The map is able to model arbitrary environments
      without prior assumptions about it. The representation models
      occupied areas as well as free space. If no information is
      available about an area (commonly denoted as unknown areas),
      this information is encoded as well. While the distinction
      between free and occupied space is essential for safe robot
      navigation, information about unknown areas is important, 
      e.g., for autonomous exploration of an environment. 
    
    * Updatable. It is possible to add new information or sensor
      readings at any time.  Modeling and updating is done in a
      probabilistic fashion. This accounts for sensor noise or
      measurements which result from dynamic changes in the
      environment, e.g., because of dynamic objects. Furthermore,
      multiple robots are able to contribute to the same map and a
      previously recorded map is extendable when new areas are
      explored.

    * Flexible. The extent of the map does not have to be known in
      advance. Instead, the map is dynamically expanded as needed. 
      The map is multi-resolution so that, for instance, a high-
      level planner is able to use a coarse map, while a local 
      planner may operate using a fine resolution. This also 
      allows for efficient visualizations which scale from coarse 
      overviews to detailed close-up views. 
    
    * Compact. The is stored efficiently, both in memory and on
      disk. It is possible to generate compressed files for later
      usage or convenient exchange between robots even under 
      bandwidth constraints.
