:description: |
  VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is designed for modeling,
  visualization, and analysis of biological systems such as proteins,
  nucleic acids, lipid bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view
  more general molecules, as VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank
  (PDB) files and display the contained structure. VMD provides a wide
  variety of methods for rendering and coloring a molecule: simple
  points and lines, CPK spheres and cylinders, licorice bonds,
  backbone tubes and ribbons, cartoon drawings, and others. VMD can be
  used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a molecular dynamics
  (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a graphical front end
  for an external MD program by displaying and animating a molecule
  undergoing simulation on a remote computer.
