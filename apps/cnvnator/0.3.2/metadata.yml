:description: |
  Copy number variation (CNV) in the genome is a complex phenomenon,
  and not completely understood. We have developed a method, CNVnator,
  for CNV discovery and genotyping from read-depth (RD) analysis of
  personal genome sequencing. Our method is based on combining the
  established mean-shift approach with additional refinements
  (multiple-bandwidth partitioning and GC correction) to broaden the
  range of discovered CNVs. We calibrated CNVnator using the extensive
  validation performed by the 1000 Genomes Project. Because of this,
  we could use CNVnator for CNV discovery and genotyping in a
  population and characterization of atypical CNVs, such as de novo
  and multi-allelic events. Overall, for CNVs accessible by RD,
  CNVnator has high sensitivity (86%-96%), low false-discovery rate
  (3%-20%), high genotyping accuracy (93%-95%), and high resolution in
  breakpoint discovery (<200 bp in 90% of cases with high sequencing
  coverage). Furthermore, CNVnator is complementary in a
  straightforward way to split-read and read-pair approaches: It
  misses CNVs created by retrotransposable elements, but more than
  half of the validated CNVs that it identifies are not detected by
  split-read or read-pair. By genotyping CNVs in the CEPH, Yoruba, and
  Chinese-Japanese populations, we estimated that at least 11% of all
  CNV loci involve complex, multi-allelic events, a considerably
  higher estimate than reported earlier. Moreover, among these events,
  we observed cases with allele distribution strongly deviating from
  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, possibly implying selection on certain
  complex loci. Finally, by combining discovery and genotyping, we
  identified six potential de novo CNVs in two family trios.
