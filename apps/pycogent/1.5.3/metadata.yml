:summary: A toolkit for making sense from sequence

:description: |
  PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully
  integrated and thoroughly tested framework for: controlling
  third-party applications; devising workflows; querying databases;
  conducting novel probabilistic analyses of biological sequence
  evolution; and generating publication quality graphics. It is
  distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities (such as true
  codon alignment) and the frequent addition of entirely new methods
  for the analysis of genomic data.

  Our primary goal is to provide a collection of rigourously validated
  tools for the manipulation and analysis of genome biology data sets.
  The project is routinely employed in numerous labs across the world
  and has provided essential capabilities for many high profile
  publications, e.g. Nature 2009 457:480-4, PNAS 2008 105:17994-9,
  Science 2008 320:1647-51, Nature 2008 453: 175-83 and Nat Genet 2007
  39: 1261-5.
