  Built to complement the rich, open source Python community, the
  Anaconda platform provides an enterprise-ready data analytics
  platform that empowers companies to adopt a modern open data science
  analytics architecture.

  With Python at its core, Anaconda is a platform for connecting your
  expertise and curiosity with data to explore and deploy innovative
  analytic apps that solve challenging problems with ease and
  agility. Processing multi-workload data analytics -- from batch
  through interactive to real-time -- the platform is used for both ad
  hoc and production deployments.

  Anaconda is tuned to take advantage of modern computing environments
  --everything from multi-core servers, to Spark and Hadoop, to GPUs
  -- delivering flexibility and allowing you to maximize your
  infrastructure investment. All of this plus the key capabilities
  required of an open source modern analytics platform -- spanning
  advanced analytics, interactive visualizations, governance, security
  and operational support.
