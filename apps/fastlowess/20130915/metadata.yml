  Files for an improved version of statsmodel's lowess.

  cylowess.pyx is Cython code for a faster version of the lowess function
  in statsmodels.nonparametric.lowess.

  This code is more or less a from-scratch re-write, borrowing from both 
  statsmodel's lowess, and from W. Cleveland's original lowess.f Fortran code.

  The main speed improvements come from:

  1. Replacing expensive lstsq() calls in the statsmodel versions with direct
     calculations of the fitted y-values.
  2. General Cython-based speedups for simple procedures in tight loops (like
     updating k-nearest neighbors).
  3. But mostly the implementation of local linear interpolation via the new
     delta parameter. This vastly reduces the amount of times weighted regressions
     are run with minimal effect on the results. The idea, is to only run regression
     at points spaced at most `delta` apart, then linearly interpolate between those
     two results.
     For moderate to large data (N > 5000) this cuts timings about 50-100x--from 
     seconds to milliseconds Currently, the default delta is zero, so the feature
     is not implemented unless explicitly set by the user. This should probably
     change.
