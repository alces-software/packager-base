# vcftools(7) -- VCFtools v1.5.2 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

VCFtools - a program package designed for working with VCF files,
such as those generated by the 1000 Genomes Project. The aim of
VCFtools is to provide methods for working with VCF files:
validating, merging, comparing and calculate some basic population
genetic statistics.

For more information on running VCFtools, please visit:

## FILES

### vcftools.sh.tpl

This example script demonstrates some of the functionality of VCFtools
by taking a VCF file from the examples folder of the VCFtools
installation directory, displaying some basic file statistics, filtering
for some variants and saving them to a seperate file, and finally,
comparing the original file to the filtered output file.
