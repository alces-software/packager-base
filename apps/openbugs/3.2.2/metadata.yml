:summary: Software for performing Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling
:url: http://www.openbugs.info/w.cgi/FrontPage
:description: |
  BUGS is a software package for performing Bayesian inference Using
  Gibbs Sampling. The user specifies a statistical model, of (almost)
  arbitrary complexity, by simply stating the relationships between
  related variables. The software includes an 'expert system', which
  determines an appropriate MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) scheme
  (based on the Gibbs sampler) for analysing the specified model. The
  user then controls the execution of the scheme and is free to choose
  from a wide range of output types.

  The specified model belongs to a class known as Directed Acyclic
  Graphs (DAGs), for which there exists an elegant underlying
  mathematical theory. This allows us to break down the analysis of
  arbitrarily large and complex structures into a sequence of
  relatively simple computations. BUGS includes a range of algorithms
  that its expert system can assign to each such computational task.
