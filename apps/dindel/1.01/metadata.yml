:summary: Calls small indels from next-generation sequence data by realigning reads to candidate haplotypes
:url: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/dindel/
:description: |
  Dindel is a program for calling small indels from next-generation
  sequence data by realigning reads to candidate haplotypes. The
  simplest use of Dindel is to consider all in indels in a
  read-alignment ﬁle (a BAM ﬁle), and to test whether each of these is
  a real indel or a sequencing error or mapping error.  Dindel can
  also test candidate indels or sequence variants from other sources,
  e.g. a database of known variants, or indels called on a different
  sample for which you want to know if it is also supported by reads
  in your current sample.
