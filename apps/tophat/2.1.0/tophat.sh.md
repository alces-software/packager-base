# tophat(7) -- Tophat v2.1.0 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns
RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra
high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the
mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons.
