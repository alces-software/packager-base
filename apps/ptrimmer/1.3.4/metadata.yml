:summary: Trim off the primer sequence from mutiplex amplicon sequencing
:url: https://github.com/DMU-lilab/pTrimmer
:description: |
  The program is used to trim off the primer sequence of the target
  sequencing at both 5'(forward primer) and 3'(reverse complement
  primer). Both k-mer indexing alogrithm and dynamic programing
  alogrithm were performed to trim off the primer sequences. The
  performing of k-mer (seed and extend) alogrithm makes it possible to
  deal with thousands of amplicon primer pairs at the same
  time. Compared with other kinds of tools, this program could trim
  the primer sequence off directly from the fastq file, which could
  save you a lot of time. There only have 250 reads in the example
  fastq file, which result in a higher mismatch ratio. But in the
  general amplicon data, the program will has a good performance and
  lower mismatch ratio.
