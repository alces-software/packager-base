:description: |
  FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees
  from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. FastTree can
  handle alignments with up to a million of sequences in a reasonable
  amount of time and memory. For large alignments, FastTree is
  100-1,000 times faster than PhyML 3.0 or RAxML 7. FastTree is
  open-source software -- you can download the code below.

  FastTree is more accurate than PhyML 3 with default settings, and
  much more accurate than the distance-matrix methods that are
  traditionally used for large alignments. FastTree uses the
  Jukes-Cantor or generalized time-reversible (GTR) models of
  nucleotide evolution and the JTT (Jones-Taylor-Thornton 1992) or WAG
  (Whelan & Goldman 2001) models of amino acid evolution. To account
  for the varying rates of evolution across sites, FastTree uses a
  single rate for each site (the "CAT" approximation). To quickly
  estimate the reliability of each split in the tree, FastTree
  computes local support values with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test
  (these are the same as PhyML 3's "SH-like local supports").
