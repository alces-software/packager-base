  HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and
  managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is
  designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and
  complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing
  applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology
  suite includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating,
  viewing, and analyzing data in the HDF5 format.
