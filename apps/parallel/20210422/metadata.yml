:description: |
  GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using
  one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small
  script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
  typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users,
  a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command
  that reads from a pipe. GNU parallel can then split the input and
  pipe it into commands in parallel.

  If you use xargs and tee today you will find GNU parallel very easy
  to use as GNU parallel is written to have the same options as
  xargs. If you write loops in shell, you will find GNU parallel may
  be able to replace most of the loops and make them run faster by
  running several jobs in parallel.

  GNU parallel makes sure output from the commands is the same output
  as you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes
  it possible to use output from GNU parallel as input for other
  programs.

  For each line of input GNU parallel will execute command with the
  line as arguments. If no command is given, the line of input is
  executed. Several lines will be run in parallel. GNU parallel can
  often be used as a substitute for xargs or cat | bash.
