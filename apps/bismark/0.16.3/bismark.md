# bismark(7) -- Bismark v0.16.3 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Bismark is a set of tools for the time-efficient analysis of Bisulfite-Seq
(BS-Seq) data. Bismark performs alignments of bisulfite-treated reads to a
reference genome and cytosine methylation calls at the same time. Bismark is
written in Perl and is run from the command line. Bisulfite-treated reads
are mapped using the short read aligner Bowtie 1 (Langmead B, Trapnell C,
Pop M, Salzberg SL.  Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA
sequences to the human genome.

## FILES

### bismark.sh.tpl

This example script demonstrates some of the functionality of VCFtools
by taking a VCF file from the examples folder of the VCFtools
installation directory, displaying some basic file statistics, filtering
for some variants and saving them to a seperate file, and finally,
comparing the original file to the filtered output file.
