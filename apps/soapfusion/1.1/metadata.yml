:summary: Fusion discovery with paired-end RNA-Seq reads
:url: http://soap.genomics.org.cn/SOAPfusion.html
:description: |
  SOAPfusion is a novel tool for fusion discovery with paired-end
  RNA-Seq reads. The tool follows a different strategy by "finding
  fusions directly and verifying them", differentiating it from all
  other existing tools by "finding the candidate regions and searching
  for the fusions afterwards". This enables the fusion discovery
  process to be more effective and sensitive, also with a specular
  performance under low coverage of sequencing far more better than
  other tools.

  In the package, it encoporates several modules developped
  specifically for mapping RNA-seq reads, finding gene fusions and
  false positive elimination. One thing to note is that the
  SOAPfusion-aligner is designed for mapping RNA-seq reads both in an
  intact manner and segemental (with long distantance in-between, or
  on different chromosomes) manner, which can be applied in other
  bioinformatics senario requiring segmental mappings as well.

  SOAPfusion is accurate and efficient for fusion discovery under
  various sequencing coverage (10X~50X, see Section "Performance")
  with high sensitivity (>=97%), low false positive rate (<=1.36%) and
  has a saturation level of 10X, highlighting its ability to detect
  fusions efficiently at low sequencing cost.

  The alogrithms and software in this package were developed by the
  Algorithm and Bioinformatics Group at The University of Hong Kong
  (Jikun Wu , Dr. S.M. Yiu). In collaboration with BGI (Zhiyu Peng,
  Wenqian Zhang).
