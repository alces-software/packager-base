# sortmerna(7) -- SortMeRNA v1.99-beta (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

SortMeRNA is a software designed to rapidly filter ribosomal RNA fragments
from metatranscriptomic data produced by next-generation sequencers. It is
capable of handling large RNA databases and sorting out all fragments
matching to the database with high accuracy and specificity.

SortMeRNA takes as input a file of reads (fasta or fastq format) and an rRNA
database (constructed using indexdb_rna (and buildtrie in versions <1.99
beta), and sorts apart the matching and non-matching reads into two files
specified by the user. Please refer to the user manual below for examples.
