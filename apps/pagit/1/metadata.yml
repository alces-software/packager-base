:description: |
  With the advent of next generation sequencing a lot of effort was
  put into developing software for mapping or aligning short reads and
  performing genome assembly. For genome assembly the problem of
  generating a draft assembly (i.e. a set of unordered contigs) has
  now been very well addressed - but for users who need high quality
  assemblies for their analyses there are still unresolved issues:
  this is where PAGIT is used.

  PAGIT addresses the need for software to generate high quality draft
  genomes. It is based on a series of programs that we developed:

   * ABACAS, that is able to contiguate contigs from a de novo
     assembly against a closely related reference.

   * IMAGE, an iterative approach for closing gaps in assembled
     genomes using mate pair information. It is able to close gaps left
     open by the assembler in a draft genome, even when using the same
     data sets as used by the original assembler.

   * iCORN, that enables errors in the consensus sequence to be
     corrected by iteratively mapping reads to the current assembly.

   * RATT, a tool to transfer the annotation from a reference genome,
     or an earlier assembly, onto the latest assembly.

  PAGIT bundles these software and makes them more accessible for users.
