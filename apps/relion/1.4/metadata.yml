  RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN, pronounce rely-on)
  is a stand-alone computer program that employs an empirical Bayesian
  approach to refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions or 2D class
  averages in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). It is developed in
  the group of Sjors Scheres at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular
  Biology. Briefly, the ill-posed problem of 3D-reconstruction is
  regularised by incorporating prior knowledge: the fact that
  macromolecular structures are smooth, i.e. they have limited power
  in the Fourier domain. In the corresponding Bayesian framework, many
  parameters of a statistical model are learned from the data, which
  leads to objective and high-quality results without the need for
  user expertise. The underlying theory is given in Scheres (2012)
  JMB. A more detailed description of its implementation is given in
  Scheres (2012) JSB. If RELION is useful in your work, please cite at
  least one of these papers.
