:summary: Cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular sequences
:url: http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/
:description: |
  BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) is a
  cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular
  sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured
  phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock
  models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but
  is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without
  conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average
  over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its
  posterior probability.
