# freeda(7) -- fREEDA v2.0 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

fREEDA(TM) is a multi-physics simulator under development by a user community
from universities, research communities and laboratories. It uses state
variables, local reference group concepts and automatic differentiation to
capture multi-physics. As a result of this, model development is considerably
simplified.

This simulation approach represents a new approach since SPICE-like analyses
were developed. The approach allows the modeling of virtually any physical
model and the generic model evaluation mechanism in which the primitive model
equations are wrapped in generic analysis specific functions, reduces the
time required for computation and development.

fREEDA(TM) implements several types of analyses. It implements a DC, Harmonic
Balance, several Time marching transient and a unique wavelet analysis. It
also implements several device models including common three and four
terminal transistors, transmission line, Foster's canonical form and diodes -
electronic, optical and tunnel types.
