# wise2(7) -- Wise2 v2.2.3 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

The Wise2 package is now a rather stately bioinformatics package
that has be around for a while. Its key programs are genewise, a
program for aligning proteins or protein HMMs to DNA, and dynamite
a rather cranky "macro language" which automates the production of
dynamic programming.  Wise2 is maintained by Ewan Birney. I had
thought that most of Wise2 development would have stopped around 3
years ago due to the developed of Guy Slater's excellent exonerate
package which handles many of the problems the Wise2 package does
but around 1,000 fold faster.
