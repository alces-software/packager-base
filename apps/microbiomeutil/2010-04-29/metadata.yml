:license: BSD
:summary: |
  A set of software utilities for processing and analyzing 16S rRNA genes
  including generating NAST alignments, chimera checking, and assembling paired
  16S rRNA reads according to reference sequence homology.

  The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) is an exciting Roadmap initiative funded
  by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goal of the project is to
  understand how the microbial communities inhabiting our bodies contribute to
  normal human health, development, and disease (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp).

  The Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org) was launched in 2004 with
  the visionary philanthropic investment of Eli and Edythe Broad, who joined
  with leaders at Harvard and its affiliated hospitals, MIT, and the Whitehead
  Institute to pioneer a "new model" of collaborative science. The Broad
  Institute is organized as a transparent infrastructure that allows biology-
  and technology-focused scientists to work together to identify and overcome
  the most critical obstacles to realizing the full promise of genomic
  medicine.

  The Broad Institute aggressively advances sequence-based technologies and the
  bioinformatics necessary to characterize the vast complexity of the human
  microbiome. In keeping with our mission, we make the microbiome analysis
  utilities developed by the Broad Institute available to the community in
  order to promote further innovation and collaborative research efforts. We
  appreciate your feedback.

  The utilities developed by the Broad Institute and provided here apply to a
  range of challenges posed by the microbiome initiative, including:

   * Sequence alignment (NAST-iEr)
   * Chimera detection (ChimeraSlayer, WigeoN)
   * Operational taxonomic unit OTU binning (TreeChopper)
   * Sequence assembly (AmosCmp16Spipeline)

  ChimeraSlayer, WigeoN, NAST-iEr, and the database of reference 16S sequences
  are provided as a single co-dependent download. Sample data and usage
  instructions are included.
