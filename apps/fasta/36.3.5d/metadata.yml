:description: |
  The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP
  program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data
  bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base
  by translating the DNA data base as it is searched.

  FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial
  pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity
  to be joined to increase the score of related sequences.

  The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of
  similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local
  sequence composition.

  The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity
  between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using
  the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these
  local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as
  individual alignments.

  In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow
  comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of
  alternative scoring matrices.
