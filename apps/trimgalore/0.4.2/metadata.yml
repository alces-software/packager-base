:summary: Wrapper tool around Cutadapt and FastQC to consistently apply quality and adapter trimming to FastQ files

:description: |
  Trim Galore! is a wrapper script to automate quality and adapter
  trimming as well as quality control, with some added functionality
  to remove biased methylation positions for RRBS sequence files (for
  directional, non-directional (or paired-end) sequencing). It's main
  features are:

    * For adapter trimming, Trim Galore! uses the first 13 bp of
      Illumina standard adapters ('AGATCGGAAGAGC') by default
      (suitable for both ends of paired-end libraries), but accepts
      other adapter sequence, too

    * For MspI-digested RRBS libraries, Trim Galore! performs quality
      and adapter trimming in two subsequent steps. This allows it to
      remove 2 additional bases that contain a cytosine which was
      artificially introduced in the end-repair step during the
      library preparation

    * For any kind of FastQ file other than MspI-digested RRBS, Trim
      Galore! can perform single-pass adapter- and quality trimming

    * The Phred quality of basecalls and the stringency for adapter
      removal can be specified individually

    * Trim Galore! can remove sequences if they become too short
      during the trimming process. For paired-end files Trim Galore!
      removes entire sequence pairs if one (or both) of the two reads
      became shorter than the set length cutoff. Reads of a read-pair
      that are longer than a given threshold but for which the partner
      read has become too short can optionally be written out to
      single-end files. This ensures that the information of a read
      pair is not lost entirely if only one read is of good quality

    * Trim Galore! can trim paired-end files by 1 additional bp from
      the 3' end of all reads to avoid problems with invalid
      alignments with Bowtie 1

    * Trim Galore! accepts and produces standard or gzip compressed
      FastQ files

    * FastQC can be run on the resulting output files once trimming
      has completed (optional)
