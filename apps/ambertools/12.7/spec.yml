:description: |
  AmberTools is a set of programs for biomolecular simulation and
  analysis. They are designed to work well with each other, and with
  the "regular" Amber suite of programs. You can perform many
  simulation tasks with AmberTools, and you can do more extensive
  simulations with the combination of AmberTools and Amber itself.
