:summary: A novel method for the efficient and robust de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data
:url: http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/
:description: |
  Trinity, developed at the Broad Institute and the Hebrew University
  of Jerusalem, represents a novel method for the efficient and robust
  de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity
  combines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis,
  and Butterfly, applied sequentially to process large volumes of
  RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many
  individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional
  complexity at at a given gene or locus, and then processes each
  graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to
  tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.
