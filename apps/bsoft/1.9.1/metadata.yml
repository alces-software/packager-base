:description: |
  Bsoft is a collection of programs and a platform for development of
  software for image and molecular processing in structural
  biology. Problems in structural biology are approached with a highly
  modular design, allowing fast development of new algorithms without
  the burden of issues such as file I/O. It provides an easily
  accessible interface, a resource that can be and has been used in
  other packages.

  The evolution of Bsoft is unique in the sense that it started from
  different aims and intentions than the typical image processing
  package. In stead of solving a particular image processing problem,
  Bsoft developed to deal with the disparities in approaches in other
  packages, as well as supporting efforts to handle large volumes of
  data and processing tasks in heterogeneous environments.
