:description: |
  The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free
  software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in
  the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1). This project
  was started as a collaborative effort between Image Power, Inc. and
  the University of British Columbia. Presently, the ongoing
  maintenance and development of the JasPer software is being
  coordinated by its principal author, Michael Adams, who is
  affiliated with the Digital Signal Processing Group (DSPG) in the
  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University
  of Victoria.

  JasPer includes a software-based implementation of the codec
  specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1).
  The JasPer software is written in the C programming language. More
  details about this software can be found in the JasPer Software
  Reference Manual.

  The JasPer software has been included in the JPEG-2000 Part-5
  standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-5), as an official reference
  implementation of the JPEG-2000 Part-1 codec. This software has also
  been incorporated into numerous other software projects (some
  commercial and some non-commercial).
