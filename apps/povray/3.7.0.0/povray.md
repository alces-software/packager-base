## DESCRIPTION

The Persistence of Vision Raytracer, or POV-Ray, is a ray tracing program
which generates images from a text-based scene description, and is available
for a variety of computer platforms. It was originally based on DKBTrace,
written by David Kirk Buck and Aaron A. Collins for the Amiga computers.
There are also influences from the earlier Polyray raytracer contributed by
its author Alexander Enzmann. POV-Ray is free and open-source software with
the source code available under the AGPLv3.
