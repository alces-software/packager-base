:description: |
  CTFFIND4 is an updated version of CTFFIND3, which is itself is an
  updated version of the program CTFFIND2, which was developed in 1998
  by Nikolaus Grigorieff at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
  Cambridge, UK with financial support from the MRC.
  
  CTFFIND determines defocus parameters from images of untilted
  specimens.  CTFFIND4 is:

    * Faster than CTFFIND 3 (2-10x, depending on runtime parameters)
    * Backward compatibility with CTFFIND 3 by giving
      --old-school-input. Should not break existing scripts
    * Completely rewritten, in object-oriented Fortran
    * New interactive user interface with friendly help (just type '?'
      to get help)
    * Improved output diagonstics, including an estimate of the
      maximum resolution at which Thon rings were detected
    * Outputs 1D profiles which accurately account for astigmatism
    * Accepts stack of micrographs as input
    * Accepts stack of movie frames as input
    * Finds the phase shift from micrographs collected using a phase
      plate
