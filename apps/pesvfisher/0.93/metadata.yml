:description: |
  PeSV-Fisher is a pipeline for the detection of five general types of
  structural variants (SVs): deletions, gains, intra- and
  inter-chromosomal translocations, and inversions, at very reasonable
  computational costs. The pipeline further provides comprehensive
  information on co-localization of SVs in the genome, a key aspect
  for studying biological consequences. The algorithm uses a
  combination of methods based on paired-reads (PR) and read-depth
  strategies (RD). PeSV-Fisher has been designed with the aim to
  facilitate identification of somatic variation, and, as such, it is
  capable of analysing two or more samples simultaneously, producing a
  list of non-shared variants between samples, although it can also
  analyse individual samples.
