:description: |
  Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility. Encrypted files
  are portable across all supported operating systems and
  processors. Passphrases must be between 8 and 56 characters and are
  hashed internally to a 448 bit key. However, all characters supplied
  are significant. The stronger your passphrase, the more secure your
  data.

  In addition to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default
  overwrite the original input file with random garbage three times
  before deleting it in order to thwart data recovery attempts by
  persons who may gain access to your computer.
