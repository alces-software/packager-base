:summary: The HPC Challenge benchmark
:url: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/index.html
:description: |
  The HPC Challenge benchmark consists of basically 7 tests:
    HPL - the Linpack TPP benchmark which measures the floating point 
          rate of execution for solving a linear system of equations.
    DGEMM - measures the floating point rate of execution of double 
          precision real matrix-matrix multiplication.
    STREAM - a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures sustainable 
          memory bandwidth (in GB/s) and the corresponding computation 
          rate for simple vector kernel.
    PTRANS (parallel matrix transpose) - exercises the communications 
          where pairs of processors communicate with each other simultaneously. 
          It is a useful test of the total communications capacity of the network.
    RandomAccess - measures the rate of integer random updates of memory (GUPS).
    FFT - measures the floating point rate of execution of double precision 
          complex one-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
    Communication bandwidth and latency - a set of tests to measure latency 
          and bandwidth of a number of simultaneous communication patterns; 
          based on b_eff (effective bandwidth benchmark).
