  virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments.

  The basic problem being addressed is one of dependencies and versions,
  and indirectly permissions. Imagine you have an application that
  needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another application requires version
  2. How can you use both these applications? If you install
  everything into /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (or whatever your
  platform's standard location is), it's easy to end up in a situation
  where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn't be
  upgraded.

  Or more generally, what if you want to install an application *and
  leave it be*? If an application works, any change in its libraries or
  the versions of those libraries can break the application.

  Also, what if you can't install packages into the global
  ``site-packages`` directory? For instance, on a shared host.

  In all these cases, ``virtualenv`` can help you. It creates an
  environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn't
  share libraries with other virtualenv environments (and optionally
  doesn't access the globally installed libraries either).
