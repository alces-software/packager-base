# fastuniq(7) -- FastUniq v1.1 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

FastUniq as an ultrafast de novo tool for removal of duplicates in paired
  short DNA sequence reads in FASTQ format. FastUniq identifies duplicates
  by comparing sequences between read pairs and does not require complete
  genome sequences as prerequisites. FastUniq is capable of simultaneously
  handling reads with different lengths and results in highly efficient 
  running time.
