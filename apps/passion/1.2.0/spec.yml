:summary: A pattern growth algorithm based pipeline for splice site detection in paired-end RNA-Seq data
:url: https://trac.nbic.nl/passion/wiki
:description: |
  PASSion uses the mapped read in a pair as anchor and then uses a high
  resolution algorithm, pattern growth, to remap the proximal and distal
  fragments of the unmapped read to a local region of the reference
  indicated by the mate. It is capable of identifying both known and
  novel canonical and non-canonical junctions with SNP or sequencing
  error tolerance. In addition, our package can discover differential
  and shared splicing patterns among multiple samples.
