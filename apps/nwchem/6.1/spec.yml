:summary: Methods for computing the properties of molecular and periodic systems
:url: http://www.nwchem-sw.org
:description: |
  NWChem provides many methods for computing the properties of
  molecular and periodic systems using standard quantum mechanical
  descriptions of the electronic wavefunction or density. Its
  classical molecular dynamics capabilities provide for the simulation
  of macromolecules and solutions, including the computation of free
  energies using a variety of force fields. These approaches may be
  combined to perform mixed quantum-mechanics and molecular-mechanics
  simulations.
