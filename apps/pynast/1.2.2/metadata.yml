:description: |
  PyNAST is a reimplementation of the NAST sequence aligner, which has
  become a popular tool for adding new 16s rDNA sequences to existing
  16s rDNA alignments. This reimplementation is more flexible, faster,
  and easier to install and maintain than the original NAST
  implementation. PyNAST is built using the PyCogent Bioinformatics
  Toolkit.

  The first versions of PyNAST (through PyNAST 1.0) were written to
  exactly match the results of the original NAST algorithm. Beginning
  with the post-PyNAST 1.0 development code, PyNAST no longer exactly
  matches the NAST output but is instead focused on getting better
  alignments. Users who wish to exactly match the results of NAST
  should download PyNAST 1.0.

  Given a set of sequences and a template alignment, PyNAST will align
  the input sequences against the template alignment, and return a
  multiple sequence alignment which contains the same number of
  positions (or columns) as the template alignment. This facilitates
  the analysis of new sequences in the context of existing alignments,
  and additional data derived from existing alignments such as
  phylogenetic trees. Because any protein or nucleic acid sequences
  and template alignments can be provided, PyNAST is not limited to
  the analysis of 16s rDNA sequences.

  PyNAST is presented in an open access Bioinformatics Applications
  Note.
