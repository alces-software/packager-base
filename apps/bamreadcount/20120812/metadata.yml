:description: |
  A tool to calculate the read count for each region in the input
  list of regions from a BAM file, and output the normalized
  read count as Read Per Million Mapped Reads per Kilobases (RPKM). To
  correct for the bias of the read count due to GC bias, it will also
  output the GC content of each region along with the total reads
  mapped to the corresponding GC content bins. By providing this
  statistic, the extent of GC bias can be investigated and if
  excessive bias is observed this statistic can be used to correct the
  global GC bias.

  This tool was initially developed for RNA-seq data to quantify
  gene/exon expression but can also be used for other purposes as
  well.
