:summary: Advanced Normalization ToolS for brain and image mapping
:url: http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS/
:description: |
  The Advanced Normalization ToolS (ANTS) package is designed to
  enable researchers with advanced tools for brain and image
  mapping. Many of the ANTS registration tools are diffeomorphic*, but
  deformation (elastic and BSpline) transformations are
  available. Unique components of ANTS include multivariate similarity
  metrics, landmark guidance, the ability to use label images to guide
  the mapping and both greedy and space-time optimal implementations
  of diffeomorphisms. The symmetric normalization (SyN) strategy is a
  part of the ANTS toolkit as is directly manipulated free form
  deformation (DMFFD).

  *Diffeomorphism: a differentiable map with differentiable
  inverse. In general, these maps are generated by integrating a
  time-dependent velocity field.
