:description: |
  Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the
  problem of harmonic inversion â€” given a discrete-time, finite-length
  signal that consists of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly
  exponentially decaying) in a given bandwidth, it determines the
  frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and phases of those
  sinusoids.

  It can, in principle, provide much better accuracy than
  straightforwardly extracting FFT peaks, essentially because it
  assumes a specific form for the signal. (Fourier transforms, in
  contrast, attempt to represent any data as a sum of sinusoidal
  components, and are thus limited by the uncertainty principle.) It
  is also often more robust than directly least-squares fitting the
  data (which can have problematic convergence), since it re-expresses
  the problem in terms of simply finding the eigenvalues of a small
  matrix.

  Harminv uses a low-storage "filter diagonalization method" (FDM) for
  finding the sinusoids near a given frequency interval.
