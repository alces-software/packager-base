:description: |
  StringTie is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments 
  into potential transcripts. It uses a novel network flow algorithm as 
  well as an optional de novo assembly step to assemble and quantitate 
  full-length transcripts representing multiple splice variants for each 
  gene locus. Its input can include not only the alignments of raw reads 
  used by other transcript assemblers, but also alignments longer sequences 
  that have been assembled from those reads.In order to identify 
  differentially expressed genes between experiments, StringTie's output 
  can be processed by specialized software like Ballgown, Cuffdiff or other 
  programs (DESeq2, edgeR, etc.).
