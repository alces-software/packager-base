:summary: A large scale machine learning toolbox
:url: http://shogun-toolbox.org/
:description: |
  The machine learning toolbox's focus is on large scale kernel
  methods and especially on Support Vector Machines (SVM). It provides
  a generic SVM object interfacing to several different SVM
  implementations, among them the state of the art OCAS, Liblinear,
  LibSVM, SVMLight, SVMLin and GPDT. Each of the SVMs can be combined
  with a variety of kernels. The toolbox not only provides efficient
  implementations of the most common kernels, like the Linear,
  Polynomial, Gaussian and Sigmoid Kernel but also comes with a number
  of recent string kernels as e.g. the Locality Improved, Fischer,
  TOP, Spectrum, Weighted Degree Kernel (with shifts). For the latter
  the efficient LINADD optimizations are implemented. For linear SVMs
  the COFFIN framework allows for on-demand computing feature spaces
  on-the-fly, even allowing to mix sparse, dense and other data
  types. Furthermore, SHOGUN offers the freedom of working with custom
  pre-computed kernels. One of its key features is the combined kernel
  which can be constructed by a weighted linear combination of a
  number of sub-kernels, each of which not necessarily working on the
  same domain. An optimal sub-kernel weighting can be learned using
  Multiple Kernel Learning. Currently SVM one-class, 2-class and
  multiclass classification and regression problems can be dealt
  with. However SHOGUN also implements a number of linear methods like
  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Programming Machine
  (LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons and features algorithms to train hidden
  markov models. The input feature-objects can be dense, sparse or
  strings and of type int/short/double/char and can be converted into
  different feature types. Chains of preprocessors (e.g. substracting
  the mean) can be attached to each feature object allowing for
  on-the-fly pre-processing.

  SHOGUN is implemented in C++ and interfaces to Matlab(tm), R, Octave
  and Python and is proudly released as Machine Learning Open Source
  Software.
