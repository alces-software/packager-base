# velvet(7) -- Velvet v1.2.10 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short
read sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by
Daniel Zerbino and Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EMBL-EBI), near Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.

Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then
produces high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired-end read
and long read information, when available, to retrieve the repeated
areas between contigs.
