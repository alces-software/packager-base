:summary: General dimension code for computing convex hulls
:url: http://www.qhull.org/
:description: |
  Qhull is a general dimension code for computing convex hulls,
  Delaunay triangulations, halfspace intersections about a point,
  Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay triangulations, and
  furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. These structures have applications
  in science, engineering, statistics, and mathematics.

  This package comprises six programs:

    * qconvex - convex hulls
    * qdelaunay - Delaunay triangulations and furthest-site Delaunay
      triangulations
    * qhalf - halfspace intersections about a point
    * qhull - all structures with additional options
    * qvoronoi - Voronoi diagrams and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams
    * rbox - generate point distributions for qhull
