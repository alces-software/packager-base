:summary: Aligns RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using uncompressed suffix arrays

  <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/1/15>

  Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging
  and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript
  structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing
  throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available
  RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping
  speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.

  To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq
  dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a
  Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq
  alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed
  search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and
  stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of
  >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 ×
  76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at
  the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In
  addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR
  can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
  transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
  sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription
  polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated
  1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90% success rate,
  corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.
