:summary: Merge paired end Illumina reads
:url: https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep/
:description: |
  SeqPrep is a program to merge paired end Illumina reads
  that are overlapping into a single longer read. It may 
  also just be used for its adapter trimming feature without 
  doing any paired end overlap. When an adapter sequence is 
  present, that means that the two reads must overlap (in 
  most cases) so they are forcefully merged. When reads do 
  not have adapter sequence they must be treated with care 
  when doing the merging, so a much more specific approach 
  is taken. The default parameters were chosen with 
  specificity in mind, so that they could be ran on 
  libraries where very few reads are expected to overlap.
