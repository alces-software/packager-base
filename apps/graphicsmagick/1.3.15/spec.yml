:description: |
  GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image
  processing. Comprised of 282K physical lines (according to David
  A. Wheeler's SLOCCount) of source code in the base package (or 964K
  including 3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and efficient
  collection of tools and libraries which support reading, writing,
  and manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including
  important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and
  TIFF.

  Image processing is multi-threaded (see the multi-thread benchmark
  results) using OpenMP so that CPU-bound tasks scale linearly as
  processor cores are added.
