:summary: Tool for buffering data streams

:description: |
  mbuffer is a tool for buffering data streams with a large set of unique features:

    * direct support for TCP based network targets (IPv4 and IPv6)
    * ability to send to multiple targets in parallel (distribution mode)
    * support for multiple volumes
    * I/O rate limitation
    * high/low watermark based restart criteria
    * configurable buffer size
    * on the fly MD5 hash calculation
    * highly efficient, multi-threaded implementation

  It is especially useful, if you are writing backups to fast tape
  drives or libraries. Those drives tend to stop and rewind if they
  have a buffer underrun. This so called tape screwing reduces the
  lifetime of the motors.  mbuffer can prevent buffer underruns, if
  used correctly and speed up the whole backup process.
