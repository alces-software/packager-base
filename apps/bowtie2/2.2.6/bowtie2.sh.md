# bowtie2(7) -- Bowtie 2 v2.2.6 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Bowtie 2 is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning
sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It is particularly
good at aligning reads of about 50 up to 100s or 1,000s of
characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively long
(e.g. mammalian) genomes. Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM
Index to keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its
memory footprint is typically around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports
gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.
