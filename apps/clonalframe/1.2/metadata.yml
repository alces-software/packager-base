:description: |
  In a nutshell, ClonalFrame identifies the clonal relationships
  between the members of a sample, while also estimating the
  chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that have
  disrupted the clonal inheritance.

  ClonalFrame can be applied to any kind of sequence data, from a
  single fragment of DNA to whole genomes. It is well suited for the
  analysis of MLST data, where 7 gene fragments have been sequenced,
  but becomes progressively more powerful as the sequenced regions
  increase in length and number up to whole genomes. However, it
  requires the sequences to be aligned. If you have genomic data that
  is not aligned, we recommend using Mauve which produces alignment of
  whole bacterial genomes in exactly the format required for analysis
  with ClonalFrame.

  The methods used in ClonalFrame are presented in the paper
  "Inference of bacterial microevolution using multilocus sequence
  data" by Didelot and Falush (2007), which is the appropriate
  citation for this program.
