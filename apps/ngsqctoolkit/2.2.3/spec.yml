  NGS QC Toolkit: A toolkit for the quality control (QC) of next
  generation sequencing (NGS) data. The toolkit comprises
  user-friendly stand alone tools for quality control of the sequence
  data generated using Illumina and Roche 454 platforms with detailed
  results in the form of tables and graphs, and filtering of
  high-quality sequence data. It also includes a few other tools,
  which are helpful in NGS data quality control and analysis.
