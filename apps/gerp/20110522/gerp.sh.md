# gerp++(7) -- GERP++ v20110522 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

GERP identifies constrained elements in multiple alignments by
quantifying substitution deficits. These deficits represent
substitutions that would have occurred if the element were neutral
DNA, but did not occur because the element has been under functional
constraint. We refer to these deficits as "Rejected
Substitutions". Rejected substitutions are a natural measure of
constraint that reflects the strength of past purifying selection on
the element.

GERP estimates constraint for each alignment column; elements are
identified as excess aggregations of constrained columns. A
false-positive rate (which is user-settable) is calculated using
'shuffled' alignments in which the order of columns is randomized.
