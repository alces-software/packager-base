  ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and
  visualization application. ParaView users can quickly build
  visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and
  quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be done
  interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch
  processing capabilities. ParaView was developed to analyze extremely
  large datasets using distributed memory computing resources. It can
  be run on supercomputers to analyze datasets of petascale as well as
  on laptops for smaller data. ParaView is an application framework as
  well as a turn-key application.

  The ParaView code base is designed in such a way that all of its
  components can be reused to quickly develop vertical
  applications. This flexibility allows ParaView developers to quickly
  develop applications that have specific functionality for a specific
  problem domain. ParaView runs on distributed and shared memory
  parallel and single processor systems. It has been successfully
  deployed on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, SGI, IBM Blue Gene, Cray and
  various Unix workstations, clusters and supercomputers. Under the
  hood, ParaView uses the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) as the data
  processing and rendering engine and has a user interface written
  using Qt(R) The goals of the ParaView team include the following:

    * Develop an open-source, multi-platform visualization
      application.
    * Support distributed computation models to process large data
      sets.
    * Create an open, flexible, and intuitive user interface.
    * Develop an extensible architecture based on open standards.
