:description: |
  GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive
  environment for the functional language Haskell. Highlights:

    * GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide
      variety of extensions.
    * GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and
      parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory
      (STM).
    * GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent
      programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer
      Language Benchmarks Game.
    * GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux,
      most varieties of Unix, and several different processor
      architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC
      to a new platform.
    * GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including
      inter-module optimisation.
    * GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or
      using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an
      intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The
      interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and
      supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
    * Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various
      kinds of heap profiling.
    * GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are
      available on Hackage.
