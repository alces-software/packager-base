:description: |
  SOAPaligner/soap2 is a member of the SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide
  Analysis Package). It is an updated version of SOAP software for
  short oligonucleotide alignment. The new program features in super
  fast and accurate alignment for huge amounts of short reads
  generated by Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer. Compared to soap v1,
  it is one order of magnitude faster. It require only 2 minutes
  aligning one million single-end reads onto the human reference
  genome. Another remarkable improvement of SOAPaligner is that it now
  supports a wide range of the read length.

  SOAPaligner benefitted in time and space efficiency by a revolution
  in the basic data structures and algorithms used.The core algorithms
  and the indexing data structures (2way-BWT) are developed by the
  algorithms research group of the Department of Computer Science, the
  University of Hong Kong (T.W. Lam, Alan Tam, Simon Wong, Edward Wu
  and S.M. Yiu).
