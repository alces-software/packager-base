:summary: Graph-based alignment of next generation sequencing reads to a population of genomes
:url: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/manual.shtml
:description: |
  HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping
  next-generation sequencing reads (whole-genome, transcriptome, and
  exome sequencing data) against the general human population (as well
  as against a single reference genome). Based on GCSA (an extension
  of BWT for a graph), we designed and implemented a graph FM index
  (GFM), an original approach and its first implementation to the best
  of our knowledge. In addition to using one global GFM index that
  represents general population, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM
  indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index
  representing a genomic region of 56 Kbp, with 55,000 indexes needed
  to cover human population). These small indexes (called local
  indexes) combined with several alignment strategies enable effective
  alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme is called
  Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM). We have developed HISAT 2 based
  on the HISAT and Bowtie2 implementations. HISAT2 outputs alignments
  in SAM format, enabling interoperation with a large number of other
  tools (e.g. SAMtools, GATK) that use SAM.
