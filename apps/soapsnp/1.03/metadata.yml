:summary: Calls consensus genotype by carefully considering data quality, alignment and recurring experimental errors

:description: |
  SOAPsnp is a member of the SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis
  Package). Despite its name, the program is a resequencing utility
  that can assemble consensus sequence for the genome of a newly
  sequenced individual based on the alignment of the raw sequencing
  reads on the known reference. The SNPs can then be identified on the
  consensus sequence through the comparison with the reference. In the
  first Asian genome re-sequencing project, evalution of SOAPsnp
  result on Illumina HapMap 1M BeadChip Duo genotyping sites shows
  great accuracy. Over 99% of the genotyping sites are covered at over
  99.9% consistency. Further PCR plus Sanger sequencing of the
  inconsistent SNP sites confirmed majority of the SOAPsnp results.

  SOAPsnp uses a method based on Bayesâ€™ theorem (the reverse
  probability model) to call consensus genotype by carefully
  considering the data quality, alignment, and recurring experimental
  errors. All these kinds of information was integrated into a single
  quality score for each base in PHRED scale to measure the accuracy
  of consensus calling. Currently, it supports the alignment format of
  SOAPaligner.
