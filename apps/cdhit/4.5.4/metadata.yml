:description: |
  CD-HIT is a very widely used program for clustering and comparing
  protein or nucleotide sequences. CD-HIT was originally developed by
  Dr. Weizhong Li at Dr. Adam Godzik's Lab at the Burnham Institute
  (now Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute)

  CD-HIT is very fast and can handle extremely large databases. CD-HIT
  helps to significantly reduce the computational and manual efforts
  in many sequence analysis tasks and aids in understanding the data
  structure and correct the bias within a dataset.

  The CD-HIT package has CD-HIT, CD-HIT-2D, CD-HIT-EST, CD-HIT-EST-2D,
  CD-HIT-454, CD-HIT-PARA, PSI-CD-HIT, CD-HIT-OTU, CD-HIT-LAP,
  CD-HIT-DUP and over a dozen scripts.

    * CD-HIT (CD-HIT-EST) clusters similar proteins (DNAs) into
      clusters that meet a user-defined similarity threshold.

    * CD-HIT-2D (CD-HIT-EST-2D) compares 2 datasets and identifies the
      sequences in db2 that are similar to db1 above a threshold.

    * CD-HIT-454 identifies natural and artificial duplicates from
      pyrosequencing reads.

    * CD-HIT-OTU clusters rRNA tags into OTUs

    * CD-HIT-DUP identifies duplicates from single or paired Illumina
      reads

    * CD-HIT-LAP identifies overlapping reads

  The usage of other programs and scripts can be found in CD-HIT
  user's guide.  CD-HIT is currently maintained by the Dr. Li's group
  (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/). We thank the support from National
  Center for Research Resources (Grant # 1R01RR025030, 2008-2011). We
  thank all users that report bugs, give us suggestions and comments.
