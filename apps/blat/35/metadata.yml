:summary: An alignment tool like BLAST
:url: http://genome.ucsc.edu/
:description: |
  Blat is an alignment tool like BLAST, but it is structured
  differently. On DNA, Blat works by keeping an index of an entire
  genome in memory. Thus, the target database of BLAT is not a set of
  GenBank sequences, but instead an index derived from the assembly of
  the entire genome. Blat of DNA is designed to quickly find
  sequences of 95% and greater similarity of length 40 bases or
  more. It may miss more divergent or short sequence alignments.

  From a practical standpoint, Blat has several advantages over BLAST:

    * speed (no queues, response in seconds) at the price of lesser
      homology depth
    * the ability to submit a long list of simultaneous queries in
      fasta format
    * five convenient output sort options
    * a direct link into the UCSC browser
    * alignment block details in natural genomic order
    * an option to launch the alignment later as part of a custom
      track

  Blat is commonly used to look up the location of a sequence in the
  genome or determine the exon structure of an mRNA, but expert users
  can run large batch jobs and make internal parameter sensitivity
  changes by installing command line Blat on their own Linux server.
