:description: |
   Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for 
   Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. It 
   was originally created to allow scientists and students to 
   visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has
   grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. 
   It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications 
   like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active 
   development since 1986.
