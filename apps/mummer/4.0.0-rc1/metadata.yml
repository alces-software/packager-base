:description: |
  MUMmer is a system for rapidly aligning DNA and protein
  sequences. The nucmer aligner in the current version (release 4.x)
  can align two mammalian genomes in about 3 hours on a typical 32+
  core workstation with 64+Gb RAM; smaller genomes such as bacteria or
  small eukaryotes are aligned in seconds or minutes. The promer
  utility generates alignments based upon the six-frame translations
  of both input sequences. promer permits the alignment of genomes for
  which the proteins are similar but the DNA sequence is too divergent
  to detect similarity. See the nucmer and promer readme files in the
  "docs/" subdirectory for more details. MUMmer is open source, and we
  ask that you cite our most recent paper in any publications that use
  this system:
