  SPAdes - St. Petersburg genome assembler - is an assembly toolkit
  containing various assembly pipelines.

  SPAdes works with Illumina or IonTorrent reads and is capable of
  providing hybrid assemblies using PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and Sanger
  reads. You can also provide additional contigs that will be used as
  long reads.

  SPAdes supports paired-end reads, mate-pairs and unpaired
  reads. SPAdes can take as input several paired-end and mate-pair
  libraries simultaneously. Note, that SPAdes was initially designed
  for small genomes. It was tested on bacterial (both single-cell MDA
  and standard isolates), fungal and other small genomes. SPAdes is
  not intended for larger genomes (e.g. mammalian size genomes). For
  such purposes you can use it at your own risk.
