:description: |
  GRASS GIS, commonly referred to as GRASS (Geographic Resources
  Analysis Support System), is a free and open source Geographic
  Information System (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data
  management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps
  production, spatial modeling, and visualization. GRASS GIS is
  currently used in academic and commercial settings around the world,
  as well as by many governmental agencies and environmental
  consulting companies. It is a founding member of the Open Source
  Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).

  GRASS GIS contains over 350 modules to render maps and images on
  monitor and paper; manipulate raster, and vector data including
  vector networks; process multispectral image data; and create,
  manage, and store spatial data. GRASS GIS offers both an intuitive
  graphical user interface as well as command line syntax for ease of
  operations. GRASS GIS can interface with printers, plotters,
  digitizers, and databases to develop new data as well as manage
  existing data.
