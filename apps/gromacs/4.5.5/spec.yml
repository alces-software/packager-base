:description: |
  GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics,
  i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with
  hundreds to millions of particles.

  It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins,
  lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded
  interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the
  nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups
  are also using it for research on non-biological systems,
  e.g. polymers.
