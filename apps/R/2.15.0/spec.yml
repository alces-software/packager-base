:summary: Language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
:url: http://www.r-project.org/
:description: |
  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
  graphics, providing a wide variety of statistical (linear and
  nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series
  analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques,
  and is highly extensible.

  The integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation,
  calculation and graphical display includes:

    * an effective data handling and storage facility
    * a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular
      matrices
    * a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools
      for data analysis
    * graphical facilities for data analysis and display either
      on-screen or on hardcopy
    * a well-developed, simple and effective programming language
      which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive
      functions and input and output facilities.
