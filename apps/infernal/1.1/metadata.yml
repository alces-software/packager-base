:description: |
  Infernal ("INFERence of RNA ALignment") is for searching DNA
  sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It
  is an implementation of a special case of profile stochastic
  context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). A CM is like a
  sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence consensus
  and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more
  capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary
  structure more than their primary sequence.
