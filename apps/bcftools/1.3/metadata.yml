:summary: Utilities for variant calling and manipulating VCF and BCF files
:url: http://www.htslib.org/
:description: |
  BCFtools is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the
  Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF. All
  commands work transparently with both VCFs and BCFs, both
  uncompressed and BGZF−compressed.

  Most commands accept VCF, bgzipped VCF and BCF with filetype
  detected automatically even when streaming from a pipe. Indexed VCF
  and BCF will work in all situations. Un−indexed VCF and BCF and
  streams will work in most, but not all situations.

  BCFtools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file
  "−" as the standard input (stdin) and outputs to the standard output
  (stdout). Several commands can thus be combined with Unix pipes.
