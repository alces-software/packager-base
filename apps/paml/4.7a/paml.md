# paml(7) -- PAML v4.7a (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

PAML is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or
protein sequences using maximum likelihood. It is maintained and
distributed for academic use free of charge by Ziheng Yang. ANSI C
source codes are distributed for UNIX/Linux/Mac OSX, and
executables are provided for MS Windows. PAML is not good for tree
making. It may be used to estimate parameters and test hypotheses
to study the evolutionary process, when you have reconstructed
trees using other programs such as PAUP*, PHYLIP, MOLPHY, PhyML,
RaxML, etc.
