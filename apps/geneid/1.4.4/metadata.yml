:description: |
  geneid is a program to predict genes in anonymous genomic
  sequences designed with a hierarchical structure. In the first
  step, splice sites, start and stop codons are predicted and scored
  along the sequence using Position Weight Arrays (PWAs). In the
  second step, exons are built from the sites. Exons are scored as
  the sum of the scores of the defining sites, plus the the
  log-likelihood ratio of a Markov Model for coding DNA. Finally,
  from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled,
  maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons. geneid
  offers some type of support to integrate predictions from multiple
  source via external gff files and the redefinition of the general
  gene structure or model is also feasible. The accuracy of geneid
  compares favorably to that of other existing tools, but geneid is
  likely more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
  Currently, geneid v1.2 analyzes the whole human genome in 3 hours
  (approx. 1 Gbp / hour) on a processor Intel(R) Xeon CPU 2.80 Ghz.
