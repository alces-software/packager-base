# cufflinks(7) -- Cufflinks v2.2.2.20150701 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and
tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq
samples. It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the
alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. Cufflinks then
estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how
many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library
preparation protocols.
