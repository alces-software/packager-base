:description: |
  Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and
  tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq
  samples. It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the
  alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. Cufflinks then
  estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how
  many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library
  preparation protocols.
