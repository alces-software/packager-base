:description: |
  QIIME (pronounced "chime") stands for Quantitative Insights Into
  Microbial Ecology. QIIME is an open source software package for
  comparison and analysis of microbial communities, primarily based on
  high-throughput amplicon sequencing data (such as SSU rRNA)
  generated on a variety of platforms, but also supporting analysis of
  other types of data (such as shotgun metagenomic data). QIIME takes
  users from their raw sequencing output through initial analyses such
  as OTU picking, taxonomic assignment, and construction of
  phylogenetic trees from representative sequences of OTUs, and
  through downstream statistical analysis, visualization, and
  production of publication-quality graphics. QIIME has been applied
  to single studies based on billions of sequences from thousands of
  samples.

  QIIME 2 is ready for experimental use while it's in its alpha
  release stage. It currently has limited microbiome analysis
  functionality as we have focused our initial efforts on building the
  underlying framework.

  Until the QIIME 2 microbiome analysis functionality has expanded, we
  recommend that you continue to use QIIME 1 and Qiita for your
  microbiome analyses, as these will provide you with complete
  analysis solutions.
