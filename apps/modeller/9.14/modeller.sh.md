# modeller(7) -- MODELLER v9.14 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

MODELLER is used for homology or comparative modeling of protein
three-dimensional structures. The user provides an alignment
of a sequence to be modeled with known related structures and
MODELLER automatically calculates a model containing all
non-hydrogen atoms. MODELLER implements comparative protein
structure modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints, and can
perform many additional tasks, including de novo modeling of loops
in protein structures, optimization of various models of protein
structure with respect to a flexibly defined objective function,
multiple alignment of protein sequences and/or structures,
clustering, searching of sequence databases, comparison of protein
structures, etc. MODELLER is available for download for most
Unix/Linux systems, Windows, and Mac.

Several graphical interfaces to MODELLER are commercially
available. There are also many other resources and people using
Modeller in graphical or web interfaces or other frameworks.
