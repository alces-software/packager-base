:description: |
  Phylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time Models (PHAST) is a freely
  available software package for comparative and evolutionary
  genomics. It consists of about half a dozen major programs, plus
  more than a dozen utilities for manipulating sequence alignments,
  phylogenetic trees, and genomic annotations (see left panel). For
  the most part, PHAST focuses on two kinds of applications: the
  identification of novel functional elements, including
  protein-coding exons and evolutionarily conserved sequences; and
  statistical phylogenetic modeling, including estimation of model
  parameters, detection of signatures of selection, and reconstruction
  of ancestral sequences. It consists of over 60,000 lines of C code.

  PHAST does not support phylogeny reconstruction or sequence
  alignment, and it is designed for use with DNA sequences only.
