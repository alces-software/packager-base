:description: |
  LOCAS is a program to assemble short reads of second generation
  sequencing technologies. It explicitly handles low coverage data by
  allowing mismatches in the overlap alignment of reads.

  An extra module, called SUPERLOCAS, provides some additional features
  for resequencing projects. In a resequencing project reads are
  mapped onto a closely related reference genome and a consensus from
  the mapped reads is calculated as an approximation of the new genome
  sequence. (Highly polymorphic regions and insert sites are not
  covered with this consenus.) SUPERLOCAS can be used to incorporate
  unmapped reads into the assembly of mapped regions and elongate this
  consenus. Further, SUPERLOCAS takes advantage of given mapping
  positions of reads.
