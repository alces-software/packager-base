# maqview(7) -- M.A.Q Viewer v0.2.5 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

Maqview is graphical read alignment viewer. It is specifically
designed for the Maq alignment file and allows you to see the
mismatches, base qualities and mapping qualities. Maqview is nothing
fancy as Consed or GAP, but just a simple viewer for you to see what
happens in a particular region.

In comparison to tgap-maq, the text-based read alignment viewer
writen by James Bonfield, Maqview is faster and takes up much less
memory and disk space in indexing. This is possibly because tgap
aims to be a general-purpose viewer but Maqview fully makes use of
the fact that a Maq alignment file has already been sorted. Maqview
is also efficient in viewing and provides a command-line tool to
quickly retrieve any region in an Maq alignment file.
