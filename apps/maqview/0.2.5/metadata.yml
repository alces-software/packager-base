:description: |
  Maqview is graphical read alignment viewer. It is specifically
  designed for the Maq alignment file and allows you to see the
  mismatches, base qualities and mapping qualities. Maqview is nothing
  fancy as Consed or GAP, but just a simple viewer for you to see what
  happens in a particular region.

  In comparison to tgap-maq, the text-based read alignment viewer
  writen by James Bonfield, Maqview is faster and takes up much less
  memory and disk space in indexing. This is possibly because tgap
  aims to be a general-purpose viewer but Maqview fully makes use of
  the fact that a Maq alignment file has already been sorted. Maqview
  is also efficient in viewing and provides a command-line tool to
  quickly retrieve any region in an Maq alignment file.
