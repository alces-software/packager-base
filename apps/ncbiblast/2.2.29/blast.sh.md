# blast(7) -- BLAST v2.2.29 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the most widely
used sequence similarity tool. There are versions of BLAST that
compare protein queries to protein databases, nucleotide queries to
nucleotide databases, as well as versions that translate nucleotide
queries or databases in all six frames and compare to protein
databases or queries.

The NCBI distributes stand-alone BLAST applications for users
who wish to run BLAST on their own machines or with their own
databases.
