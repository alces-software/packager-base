:description: |
  A tandem repeat in DNA is two or more adjacent, approximate copies
  of a pattern of nucleotides. Tandem Repeats Finder is a program to
  locate and display tandem repeats in DNA sequences. In order to use
  the program, the user submits a sequence in FASTA format. There is
  no need to specify the pattern, the size of the pattern or any other
  parameter. The output consists of two files: a repeat table file and
  an alignment file. The repeat table contains information about each
  repeat, including its location, size, number of copies and
  nucleotide content. 

  The program is very fast, analyzing sequences on the order of .5Mb
  in just a few seconds. Submitted sequences may be of arbitrary
  length. Repeats with pattern size in the range from 1 to 2000 bases
  are detected.
