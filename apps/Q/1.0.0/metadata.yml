:description: |
  Q is a fast saturation-based ChIP-seq peak caller.
  Q works well in conjunction with the irreproducible discovery 
  rate (IDR) procedure.
  Q was extensively tested on publicly available datasets from 
  ENCODE and shown to perform well with respect to reproducibility 
  of the called peak set, consistency of the peak sets with respect 
  to predicted transcription factor binding motifs contained in 
  them, as well as overall run time.
  Q is implemented in C++ making use of the Boost and SeqAn library.
