:description: |
  RnaChipIntegrator is a utility that performs integrated analyses of
  'gene' data (a set of genes or other genomic features) with 'peak'
  data (a set of regions, for example ChIP peaks) to identify the
  genes nearest to each peak, and vice versa.

  The program was originally written specifically for ChIP-Seq and
  RNA-Seq data but works equally well for ChIP-chip and microarray
  expression data, and can also be used to integrate any set of
  genomic features (e.g. canonical genes, CpG islands) with peak data.
