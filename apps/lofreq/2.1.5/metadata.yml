:summary: Fast and sensitive variant-caller for inferring SNVs from high-throughput sequencing data
:url: http://sourceforge.net/p/lofreq/wiki/Home/
:description: |
  LoFreq is a fast and sensitive variant-caller for inferring
  single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) from high-throughput sequencing
  data. It is designed to robustly call low-frequency variants by
  exploiting base-call quality values. LoFreq has been used to call
  rare variants in viral and bacterial sequencing datasets and can be
  used to study mitochondrial heteroplasmy and rare somatic mutations
  in heterogeneous tumors.

  LoFreq makes full use of base-call qualities (and versions >=0.5
  also use read mapping qualities) which are usually ignored by other
  methods or only used for filtering. It is very sensitive; most
  notably, it is able to predict variants below the average base-call
  quality (i.e. sequencing error rate). Each SNV call is assigned a
  p-value which allows for rigorous false positive control. Even
  though it uses no approximations or heuristics, it is very efficient
  due to several runtime optimizations. LoFreq is generic and fast
  enough to be applied to high-coverage data and large genomes. It
  takes a minute to analyze Dengue genome sequencing data with nearly
  4000X coverage, roughly one hour to call SNVs on a 600X coverage
  E.coli genome and 1.5 hours to run on a 100X coverage human exome
  dataset.
