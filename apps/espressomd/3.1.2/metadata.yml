:description: |
  ESPResSo is a highly versatile software package for performing and
  analyzing scientific Molecular Dynamics many-particle simulations of
  coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring models as they are used in
  soft-matter research in physics, chemistry and molecular biology. It
  can be used to simulate systems such as polymers, liquid crystals,
  colloids, ferrofluids and biological systems, for example DNA and
  lipid membranes.

  ESPResSo is free, open-source software published under the GNU
  General Public License (GPL). It is parallelized and can be employed
  on desktop machines, convenience clusters as well as on
  supercomputers with hundreds of CPUs. The parallel code is
  controlled via the scripting language Tcl, which gives the software
  its great flexibility.

  ESPResSo is used in scientific working groups all over the world
  both as a production platform as well as a research platform for
  developing new algorithms and methods for coarse-grained
  simulations.  It is mainly developed at the Institute for
  Computational Physics of the University of Stuttgart, but has
  contributors from all over the world.
