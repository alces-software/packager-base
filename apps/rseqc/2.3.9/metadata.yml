:description: |
  Deep transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) provides massive and valuable
  information about functional elements in the genome. Ideally, transcriptome
  sequencing should be able to directly identify and quantify all RNA species,
  small or large, low or high abundance. However, RNA-seq is a complicated,
  multistep process involving sample preparation, amplification,
  fragmentation, purification and sequencing. A single improper operation
  would result in biased or even unusable data. Therefore, it is always a good
  practice to check the quality of your RNA-seq data before analyses. Here we
  developed RSeQC package to comprehensively evaluate RNA-seq datasets
  generated from clinical tissues or other well annotated organisms such as
  mouse, fly and yeast. For organisms lacking reference gene models, many
  modules will not work.

  RSeQC package provides a number of useful modules that can comprehensively
  evaluate high throughput sequence data especially RNA-seq data. “Basic
  modules” quickly inspect sequence quality, nucleotide composition bias, PCR
  bias and GC bias, while “RNA-seq specific modules” investigate sequencing
  saturation status of both splicing junction detection and expression
  estimation, mapped reads clipping profile, mapped reads distribution,
  coverage uniformity over gene body, reproducibility, strand specificity and
  splice junction annotation
