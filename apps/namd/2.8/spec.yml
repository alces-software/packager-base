:summary: A parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems
:url: http://www.gromacs.org/
:description: |
  NAMD, recipient of a 2002 Gordon Bell Award, is a parallel molecular
  dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large
  biomolecular systems. Based on Charm++ parallel objects, NAMD scales
  to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms and tens of
  processors on commodity clusters using gigabit ethernet. NAMD uses
  the popular molecular graphics program VMD for simulation setup and
  trajectory analysis, but is also file-compatible with AMBER, CHARMM,
  and X-PLOR.
