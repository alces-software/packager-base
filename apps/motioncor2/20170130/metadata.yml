:description: |
  Correction of electron beam-induced sample motion is one of the major 
  factors contributing to the recent resolution breakthroughs in 
  cryo-electron microscopy. Based on observations that the electron beam 
  induces doming of the thin vitreous ice layer, we developed an 
  algorithm to correct anisotropic image motion at the single pixel 
  level across the whole frame, suitable for both single particle and 
  tomographic images. Iterative, patch-based motion detection is combined 
  with spatial and temporal constraints and dose weighting. The multi-GPU 
  accelerated program, MotionCor2, is sufficiently fast to keep up with 
  automated data collection. The result is an exceptionally robust 
  strategy that can work on a wide range of data sets, including those 
  very close to focus or with very short integration times, obviating the 
  need for particle polishing. Application significantly improves Thon 
  ring quality and 3D reconstruction resolution.
