:description: |
  FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode,
  transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything
  that humans and machines have created. It supports the most obscure
  ancient formats up to the cutting edge. No matter if they were
  designed by some standards committee, the community or a
  corporation. It contains libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat,
  libavfilter, libavdevice, libswscale and libswresample which can be
  used by applications, as well as ffmpeg, ffserver, ffplay and
  ffprobe which can be used by end users for transcoding, streaming
  and playing.
