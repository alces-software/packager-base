:summary: Gctf - real-time CTF determination and correction

:description: |
  Accurate estimation of the contrast transfer function (CTF) is critical 
  for a near-atomic resolution cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) 
  reconstruction. Here, a GPU-accelerated computer program, Gctf, for 
  accurate and robust, real-time CTF determination is presented. The main 
  target of Gctf is to maximize the cross-correlation of a simulated CTF 
  with the logarithmic amplitude spectra (LAS) of observed micrographs 
  after background subtraction. Novel approaches in Gctf improve both 
  speed and accuracy. In addition to GPU acceleration (e.g. 10–50×), a 
  fast 1-dimensional search plus 2-dimensional refinement (1S2R) procedure 
  further speeds up Gctf. Based on the global CTF determination, the local 
  defocus for each particle and for single frames of movies is accurately 
  refined, which improves CTF parameters of all particles for subsequent 
  image processing. Novel diagnosis method using equiphase averaging (EPA) 
  and self-consistency verification procedures have also been implemented 
  in the program for practical use, especially for aims of near-atomic 
  reconstruction. Gctf is an independent program and the outputs can be 
  easily imported into other cryoEM software such as Relion (Scheres, 2012) 
  and Frealign (Grigorieff, 2007)
