:summary: A fully developed set of DNA sequence assembly (Gap4 and Gap5), editing and analysis tools (Spin)

:description: |
  The sequence handling and analysis software developed at the Medical
  Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK,
  which has come to be known as the Staden Package.

  The focus of the group since 1990 has been to produce improved
  methods for processing the data for large scale sequencing projects,
  and this is reflected in the scope of the package: the most advanced
  components (trev, prefinish, pregap4 and gap4) are those used in
  that area. Nevertheless the package also contains a program (spin)
  for the analysis and comparison of finished sequences. The latter
  also provides a graphical user interface to EMBOSS.

  Gap4 performs sequence assembly, contig ordering based on read pair
  data, contig joining based on sequence comparisons, assembly
  checking, repeat searching, experiment suggestion, read pair
  analysis and contig editing. It has graphical views of contigs,
  templates, readings and traces which all scroll in register. Contig
  editor searches and experiment suggestion routines use confidence
  values to calculate the confidence of the consensus sequence and
  hence identify only places requiring visual trace inspection or
  extra data. The result is extremely rapid finishing and a consensus
  of known accuracy.

  Pregap4 provides a graphical user interface to set up the processing
  required to prepare trace data for assembly or analysis. It also
  automates these processes. The possible processes which can be set
  up and automated include trace format conversion, quality analysis,
  vector clipping, contaminant screening, repeat searching and
  mutation detection.

  Trev is a rapid and flexible viewer and editor for ABI, ALF, SCF and
  ZTR trace files.

  Prefinish analyses partially completed sequence assemblies and
  suggests the most efficient set of experiments to help finish the
  project.

  Tracediff and hetscan automatically locate mutations by comparing
  trace data against reference traces. They annotate the mutations
  found ready for viewing in gap4.

  Spin analyses nucleotide sequences to find genes, restriction sites,
  motifs, etc. It can perform translations, find open reading frames,
  count codons, etc. Many results are presented graphically and a
  sliding sequence window is linked to the graphics cursor. Spin also
  compares pairs of sequences in many ways. It has very rapid dot
  matrix analysis, global and local alignment algorithms, plus a
  sliding sequence window linked to the graphical plots. It can
  compare nucleic acid against nucleic acid, protein against protein,
  and protein against nucleic acid.
