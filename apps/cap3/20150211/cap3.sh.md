# cap3(7) -- CAP3 v20150211 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

An improved version of the CAP sequence assembly program. The following
  improvements have been made:

  1. Use of forward-reverse constraints to correct assembly errors and link
  contigs.

  2. Use of base quality values in alignment of sequence reads.

  3. Automatic clipping of 5' and 3' poor regions of reads.

  4. Generation of assembly results in ace file format for Consed.

  5. CAP3 can be used in GAP4 of the Staden package.

  These improvements allow CAP3 to take longer sequences of higher errors and
  produce more accurate consensus sequences.
