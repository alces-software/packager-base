# mira(7) -- MIRA v4.0.2 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

MIRA is a whole genome shotgun and EST sequence assembler for
Sanger, 454, Solexa (Illumina), IonTorrent data and PacBio (the
later at the moment only CCS and error-corrected CLR reads). It can
be seen as a Swiss army knife of sequence assembly developed and
used in the past 12 years to get assembly jobs done efficiently -
and especially accurately. That is, without actually putting too
much manual work into finishing the assembly.
