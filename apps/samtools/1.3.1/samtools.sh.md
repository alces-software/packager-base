# samtools(7) -- SAM Tools v1.3.1 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format is a generic format for storing
large nucleotide sequence alignments. SAM aims to be a format that:

  * Is flexible enough to store all the alignment information
    generated by various alignment programs
  * Is simple enough to be easily generated by alignment programs or
    converted from existing alignment formats
  * Is compact in file size
  * Allows most of operations on the alignment to work on a stream
    without loading the whole alignment into memory
  * Allows the file to be indexed by genomic position to efficiently
    retrieve all reads aligning to a locus

SAM Tools provide various utilities for manipulating alignments in
the SAM format, including sorting, merging, indexing and generating
alignments in a per-position format.
