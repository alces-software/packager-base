:description: |
  Rvtests, which stands for Rare Variant tests, is a flexible software package for
  genetic association studies. It is designed to support unrelated individual or
  related (family-based) individuals. Both quantitative trait and binary trait are
  supported. It includes a variety of association tests (e.g. single variant score
  test, burden test, variable threshold test, SKAT test, fast linear mixed model
  score test). It takes VCF format as genotype input file and takes PLINK format
  phenotype file and covariate file. From our practice, it is capable to analyze
  8,000 related individuals using less than 400 Mb memory.
