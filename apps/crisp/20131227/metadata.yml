:summary: Multi-sample variant caller for high-throughput pooled sequence data
:url: https://sites.google.com/site/vibansal/software/crisp
:description: |
  CRISP is a software program designed to detect SNPs and short indels
  from high-throughput sequencing of pooled DNA samples. CRISP has
  been primarily developed to analyze data from "artificial" DNA
  pools, i.e. pools generated by equi-molar pooling of DNA from
  multiple individual samples. CRISP leverages sequence data from
  multiple such pools to detect both rare and common variants. Note
  that the method is not designed for variant detection from a single
  pool. CRISP has been tested on a number of pooled targeted capture
  datasets as well as exome sequence data generated using the Illumina
  sequencing platform.  CRISP works directly with sorted BAM files and
  outputs a single VCF file with information about the variants and
  the genotypes (or allele frequencies) for each pool or sample. CRISP
  can identify both SNVs and short insertion/deletions (indels).
  CRISP is implemented in C and uses the SAMtools API to read bam
  files. The latest version of CRISP should work well even for diploid
  genomes (pool size = 2).
