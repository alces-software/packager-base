  The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is
  developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and
  industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the
  expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High
  Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI
  library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and
  software vendors, application developers and computer science
  researchers.
