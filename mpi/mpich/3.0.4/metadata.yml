:description: |
  MPICH is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of
  the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (MPI-1, MPI-2 and
  MPI-3). The goals of MPICH are:

  1. to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports
     different computation and communication platforms including
     commodity clusters (desktop systems, shared-memory systems,
     multicore architectures), high-speed networks (10 Gigabit
     Ethernet, InfiniBand, Myrinet, Quadrics) and proprietary high-end
     computing systems (Blue Gene, Cray)

  2. to enable cutting-edge research in MPI through an easy-to-extend
     modular framework for other derived implementations.

  MPICH was originally developed during the MPI standards process
  starting in 1992 to provide feedback to the MPI Forum on
  implementation and usability issues.  This original implementation
  was based on the Chameleon portability system to provide a
  light-weight implementation layer (hence the name MPICH from MPI
  over CHameleon).  Around 2001, development had begun on a new
  implementation named MPICH2.  MPICH2 implemented additional features
  of the MPI-2 standard over what was implemented in the original
  MPICH (now referred to as MPICH-1).  The final release of the
  original MPICH is 1.2.7p1.  The version numbers of MPICH2 were
  restarted at 0.9 and continue to 1.5. Starting with the major
  release in November 2012, the project is renamed back to MPICH with
  a version number of 3.0.
