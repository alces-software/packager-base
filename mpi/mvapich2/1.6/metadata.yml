:summary: MPI-2 over OpenFabrics-IB, OpenFabrics-iWARP, PSM, uDAPL and TCP/IP
:url: http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/overview/mvapich2/
:description: |
  This is an MPI-2 implementation (conforming to MPI 2.2 standard)
  which includes all MPI-1 features. It is based on MPICH2 and MVICH.

  The current release supports the following ten underlying transport
  interfaces:

  * OFA-IB-CH3: This interface supports all InfiniBand compliant
    devices based on the OpenFabrics Gen2 layer. This interface has
    the most features and is most widely used. For example, this
    interface can be used over all Mellanox InfiniBand adapters, IBM
    eHCA adapters and Qlogic adapters.

  * OFA-IB-Nemesis: This interface supports all InfiniBand compliant
    devices based on the OpenFabrics libibverbs layer with the
    emerging Nemesis channel of the MPICH2 stack. This interface can
    be used by all Mellanox InfiniBand adapters.

  * OFA-iWARP-CH3: This interface supports all iWARP compliant devices
    supported by OpenFabrics. For example, this layer supports Chelsio
    T3 adapters with the native iWARP mode.

  * OFA-RoCE-CH3: This interface supports the emerging RoCE (RDMA over
    Convergence Ethernet) interface for Mellanox ConnectX-EN adapters
    with 10GigE switches.

  * PSM-CH3: This interface provides native support for InfiniPath
    adapters from QLogic over PSM interface. It provides
    high-performance point-to-point communication for both one-sided
    and two-sided operations.

  * uDAPL-CH3: This interface supports all network-adapters and
    software stacks which implement the portable DAPL interface from
    the DAT Collaborative. For example, this interface can be used
    over all Mellanox adapters, Chelsio adapters and NetEffect
    adapters. It can also be used with Solaris uDAPL-IBTL
    implementation over InfiniBand adapters.

  * Shared-Memory-CH3: This interface provides native shared memory
    support on multi-core platforms where communication is required
    only within a node. Such as SMP-only systems, laptops, etc.

  * TCP/IP-CH3: The standard TCP/IP interface (provided by MPICH2) to
    work with a range of network adapters supporting TCP/IP
    interface. This interface can be used with IPoIB (TCP/IP over
    InfiniBand network) support of InfiniBand also. However, it will
    not deliver good performance/ scalability as compared to the other
    interfaces.

  * TCP/IP-Nemesis: The standard TCP/IP interface (provided by MPICH2
    Nemesis channel) to work with a range of network adapters
    supporting TCP/IP interface. This interface can be used with IPoIB
    (TCP/IP over InfiniBand network) support of InfiniBand
    also. However, it will not deliver good performance/ scalability
    as compared to the other interfaces.

  * Shared-Memory-Nemesis: This interface provides native shared
    memory support on multi-core platforms where communication is
    required only within a node. Such as SMP-only systems, laptops,
    etc.
