:description: |
  MPICH2 is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of
  the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard (both MPI-1 and
  MPI-2). The goals of MPICH2 are: 

  1. to provide an MPI implementation that efficiently supports
     different computation and communication platforms including
     commodity clusters (desktop systems, shared-memory systems,
     multicore architectures), high-speed networks (10 Gigabit
     Ethernet, InfiniBand, Myrinet, Quadrics) and proprietary high-end
     computing systems (Blue Gene, Cray, SiCortex)
  
  2. to enable cutting-edge research in MPI through an easy-to-extend
     modular framework for other derived implementations.

  MPICH2 replaces MPICH1 and should be used instead of MPICH1 except
  for the case of clusters with heterogeneous data representations
  (e.g., different lengths for integers or different byte
  ordering). MPICH2 does not yet support those systems.
