:description: |
  Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving
  large complicated nonlinear least squares problems. It is a feature
  rich, mature and performant library which has been used in
  production since 2010. At Google, Ceres Solver is used to:

    * Estimate the pose of Street View cars, aircrafts, and
      satellites.
    * Build 3D models for PhotoTours.
    * Estimate satellite image sensor characteristics.
    * Stitch panoramas or apply Lens Blur on Android.
    * Solve bundle adjustment and SLAM problems in Project Tango.

  Outside Google, Ceres is used for solving problems in computer
  vision, computer graphics, astronomy and physics. e.g., Willow
  Garage uses it to solve SLAM problems and Blender uses it for for
  planar tracking and bundle adjustment.
