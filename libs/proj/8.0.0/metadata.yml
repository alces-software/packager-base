:summary: Generic coordinate transformation software
:url: https://proj.org/
:description: |
  PROJ is a generic coordinate transformation software that transforms
  geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to
  another. This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic
  transformations. PROJ is released under the X/MIT open source
  license

  PROJ includes command line applications for easy conversion of
  coordinates from text files or directly from user input. In addition
  to the command line utilities PROJ also exposes an application
  programming interface, or API in short. The API lets developers use
  the functionality of PROJ in their own software without having to
  implement similar functionality themselves.

  PROJ started purely as a cartography application letting users
  convert geodetic coordinates into projected coordinates using a
  number of different cartographic projections. Over the years, as the
  need has become apparent, support for datum shifts has slowly worked
  its way into PROJ as well. Today PROJ supports more than a hundred
  different map projections and can transform coordinates between
  datums using all but the most obscure geodetic techniques.
