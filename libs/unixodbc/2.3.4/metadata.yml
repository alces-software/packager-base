:summary: An open source project that implements the ODBC API
:url: http://www.unixodbc.org/ 
:description: |
  unixODBC is an open source project that implements the ODBC API. The 
  code is provided under the GNU GPL/LGPL and can be built and used on 
  many different operating systems, including most versions of Unix, 
  Linux, Mac OS X, IBM OS/2 and Microsoft's Interix.

  The goals of the project include:

  * Provide developers with the tools to port Microsoft Windows ODBC 
    applications to other platforms with the minimum of code changes.
  * Maintain the project as a vendor neutral interface database SDK
  * Provide people who write ODBC drivers the tools to port their 
    drivers to non Windows platforms
  * Provide the user with a set of GUI and command line tools for 
    managing their database access
  * Maintain links with both the free software community and commercial 
    database vendors, to ensure interoperability
