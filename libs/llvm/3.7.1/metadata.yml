:summary: A modern source- and target-independent optimizer with code generation support

:description: |
  The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler
  and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do
  with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful
  libraries that can be used to build them. The name "LLVM" itself is
  not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.

  LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with
  the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy
  capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of
  arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an
  umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects, many of
  which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial
  and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic
  research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the "UIUC"
  BSD-Style license.

  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and
  target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for
  many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These
  libraries are built around a well specified code representation
  known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR"). The LLVM
  Core libraries are well documented, and it is particularly easy to
  invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use LLVM
  as an optimizer and code generator.
