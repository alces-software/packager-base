:summary: A cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit providing modern GUI functionality without the bloat
:url: http://www.fltk.org/
:description: |
  FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for
  UNIX®/Linux® (X11), Microsoft® Windows®, and MacOS® X. FLTK provides
  modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics
  via OpenGL® and its built-in GLUT emulation.

  FLTK is designed to be small and modular enough to be statically
  linked, but works fine as a shared library. FLTK also includes an
  excellent UI builder called FLUID that can be used to create
  applications in minutes.
