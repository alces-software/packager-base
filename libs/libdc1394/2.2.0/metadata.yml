:summary: High level API to control digital cameras.
:url: http://damien.douxchamps.net/ieee1394/libdc1394/
:description: |
  libdc1394 is a library that provides a complete high level application
  programming interface (API) for developers who wish to control IEEE 1394
  based cameras that conform to the 1394-based Digital Camera Specifications
  (also known as the IIDC or DCAM Specifications). The library is currently the
  only one to run on all three major platforms (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows). On
  Linux, both the legacy drivers (raw1394/video1394) and the new "juju" stack
  (firewire-ohci) are supported and auto-detected.

  libdc1394 provides a complete API that includes camera detection (hotplug
  coming soon), broadcast commands, bus ressource management (basic), full
  feature controls (including absolute values), memory channels, external and
  software trigger, support for all video modes (including 16bit modes and
  1394B modes at 800Mb/s), video capture using DMA and full Format_7 control.
  Moreover, libdc1394 also includes a number extras such as the support of
  vendor specific features for Allied Vision Technologies (AVT), Basler and
  PixelInk. The library also includes video conversion tools such as color
  space conversion (YUV, RGB, MONO, etc...) and the demosaicing of Bayer color
  pattern images (with 8 different algorithms and including 16bit modes). All
  these features in combination with the multi-platform compatibility makes
  libdc1394 the most versatile and performant SDK for IIDC cameras. Moreover,
  it's open source (license: LGPL) and it's free! Several examples are also
  provided to put you quickly on the right tracks.

  libdc1394 works with every camera that follows the IIDC standard, which is
  about 500 models. Check the IEEE1394 Digital Camera List for more information.
