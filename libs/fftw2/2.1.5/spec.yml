:summary: C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions
:url: http://www.fftw.org/
:description: |
  FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier
  transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size,
  and of both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data,
  i.e. the discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).
