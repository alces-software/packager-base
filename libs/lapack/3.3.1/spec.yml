:summary: Linear Algebra PACKage - routines for equation solving systems
:url: http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
:description: |
  Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) is written in Fortran 90 and
  provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
  equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
  eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated
  matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized
  Schur) are also provided, as are related computations such as
  reordering of the Schur factorizations and estimating condition
  numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but not general
  sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is provided for
  real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.
