:description: |
  GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) is a C++ port of the  Java
  Topology Suite (JTS). As such, it aims to contain the complete
  functionality of JTS in C++. This includes all the  OpenGIS Simple
  Features for SQL spatial predicate functions and spatial operators,
  as well as specific JTS enhanced topology functions.

  GEOS is available under the terms of  GNU Lesser General Public
  License (LGPL), and is a project of  OSGeo.

  Capabilities Include:

    * Geometries: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
    * Predicates: Intersects, Touches, Disjoint, Crosses, Within, Contains, Overlaps, Equals, Covers
    * Operations: Union, Distance, Intersection, Symmetric Difference, Convex Hull, Envelope, Buffer, Simplify, Polygon Assembly, Valid, Area, Length,
    * Prepared geometries (pre-spatially indexed)
    * STR spatial index
    * OGC Well Known Text (WKT) and Well Known Binary (WKB) encoders and decoders.
    * C and C++ API (C API gives long term ABI stability)
    * Thread safe (using the reentrant API)
