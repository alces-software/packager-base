:description: |
  NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for
  array-oriented data access and a freely-distributed collection of
  data access libraries for C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other
  languages. The netCDF libraries support a machine-independent format
  for representing scientific data. Together, the interfaces,
  libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
  scientific data.

  NetCDF data is:

    * Self-Describing - a netCDF file includes information about the
      data it contains
    * Portable - a netCDF file can be accessed by computers with
      different ways of storing integers, characters, and
      floating-point numbers
    * Scalable - a small subset of a large dataset may be accessed
      efficiently
    * Appendable - data may be appended to a properly structured
      netCDF file without copying the dataset or redefining its
      structure
    * Sharable - one writer and multiple readers may simultaneously
      access the same netCDF file
    * Archivable - access to all earlier forms of netCDF data will be
      supported by current and future versions of the software
