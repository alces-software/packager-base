:summary: Modern, powerful open source C++ class libraries and frameworks for building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop, server, mobile and embedded systems.

  POrtable COmponents C++ Libraries are:

   * A collection of C++ class libraries, conceptually similar to the Java
     Class Library, the .NET Framework or Apple’s Cocoa.
   * Focused on solutions to frequently-encountered practical problems.
   * Focused on ‘internet-age’ network-centric applications.
   * Written in efficient, modern, 100% ANSI/ISO Standard C++.
   * Based on and complementing the C++ Standard Library/STL.
   * Highly portable and available on many different platforms.
   * Open Source, licensed under the Boost Software License.

  In regards to Boost, in spite of some functional overlapping, POCO is best
  thought of as a Boost complement (rather than replacement). Side-by-side use of
  Boost and POCO is a very common occurence.  :group: Libraries
