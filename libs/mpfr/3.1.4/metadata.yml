:summary: C library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding
:url: http://www.mpfr.org/
:description: |
  The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision
  floating-point computations with correct rounding. MPFR has
  continuously been supported by the INRIA and the current main
  authors come from the Caramba and AriC project-teams at Loria
  (Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) respectively; see more on the
  credit page. MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

  The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
  floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a
  well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the
  ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point
  arithmetic (53-bit significand).
