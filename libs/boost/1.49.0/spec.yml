:summary: Free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries
:url: http://www.boost.org/
:description: |
  Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. The
  emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
  Library, in the hopes of establishing "existing practice" for
  extensions and providing reference implementations so that the Boost
  libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some of the
  libraries have already been proposed for inclusion in the C++
  Standards Committee's upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical
  Report.)
