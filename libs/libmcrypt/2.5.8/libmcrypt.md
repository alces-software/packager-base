# libmcrypt(7) -- LibMCrypt v2.5.8 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

MCrypt is a replacement for the old crypt() package and 
crypt(1) command, with extensions. It allows developers 
to use a wide range of encryption functions, without 
making drastic changes to their code. It allows users 
to encrypt files or data streams without having to be 
cryptographers. Above all, it allows you to have some 
really neat code on your machine. :)

The companion to MCrypt is Libmcrypt, which contains the 
actual encryption functions themselves, and provides a 
standardized mechanism for accessing them.
