:description: |
  The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular
  expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
  Perl 5. PCRE has its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper
  functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API. The
  PCRE library is free, even for building proprietary software.

  There are two major versions of the PCRE library. The newest
  version, PCRE2, was released in 2015.

  The original, very widely deployed PCRE library was originally
  released in 1997.  The API and feature set are stableâ€”future
  releases will be for bugfixes only. All new future features will be
  to PCRE2, not the original PCRE 8.x series.
