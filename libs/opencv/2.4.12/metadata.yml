:description: |
  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source
  computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was
  built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision
  applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the
  commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it
  easy for businesses to utilize a nd modify the code.

  The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes
  a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer
  vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used
  to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human
  actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects,
  extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo
  cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image
  of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database,
  remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements,
  recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented
  reality, etc. OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user
  community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 5 million. The
  library is used extensively in companies, research groups and by
  governmental bodies.
