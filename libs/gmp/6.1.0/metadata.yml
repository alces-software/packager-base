:summary: Library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
:url: https://gmplib.org/
:description: |
  GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating
  on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point
  numbers. There is no practical limit to the precision except the
  ones implied by the available memory in the machine GMP runs on. GMP
  has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular
  interface.

  The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications
  and research, Internet security applications, algebra systems,
  computational algebra research, etc.

  GMP is carefully designed to be as fast as possible, both for small
  operands and for huge operands. The speed is achieved by using
  fullwords as the basic arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms,
  with highly optimised assembly code for the most common inner loops
  for a lot of CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed.
