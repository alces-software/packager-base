:summary: The Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM) format
:url: http://biom-format.org/
:description: |
  The BIOM file format (canonically pronounced biome) is designed to
  be a general-use format for representing biological sample by
  observation contingency tables. BIOM is a recognized standard for
  the Earth Microbiome Project and is a Genomics Standards Consortium
  candidate project.

  The BIOM format is designed for general use in broad areas of
  comparative -omics. For example, in marker-gene surveys, the primary
  use of this format is to represent OTU tables: the observations in
  this case are OTUs and the matrix contains counts corresponding to
  the number of times each OTU is observed in each sample. With
  respect to metagenome data, this format would be used to represent
  metagenome tables: the observations in this case might correspond to
  SEED subsystems, and the matrix would contain counts corresponding
  to the number of times each subsystem is observed in each
  metagenome. Similarly, with respect to genome data, this format may
  be used to represent a set of genomes: the observations in this case
  again might correspond to SEED subsystems, and the counts would
  correspond to the number of times each subsystem is observed in each
  genome.

  There are two components to the BIOM project: first is definition of
  the BIOM format, and second is development of support objects in
  multiple programming languages to support the use of BIOM in diverse
  bioinformatics applications. The version of the BIOM file format is
  independent of the version of the biom-format software.
