:summary: A general purpose library for evaluating the likelihood of sequence evolution on trees
:url: https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib
:description: |
  BEAGLE is a high-performance library that can perform the core
  calculations at the heart of most Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood
  phylogenetics packages. It can make use of highly-parallel
  processors such as those in graphics cards (GPUs) found in many PCs.

  The project involves an open API and fast implementations of a
  library for evaluating phylogenetic likelihoods (continuous time
  Markov processes) of biomolecular sequence evolution.

  The aim is to provide high performance evaluation 'services' to a
  wide range of phylogenetic software, both Bayesian samplers and
  Maximum Likelihood optimizers. This allows these packages to make
  use of implementations that make use of optimized hardware such as
  graphics processing units.
