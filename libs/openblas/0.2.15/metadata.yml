:summary: An optimized BLAS library
:url: http://www.openblas.net/
:description: |
  OpenBLAS is an open source BLAS library forked from the
  GotoBLAS2-1.13 BSD version. Since Mr. Kazushige Goto left TACC,
  GotoBLAS is no longer being maintained. This project was created to
  continue developing OpenBLAS/GotoBLAS.

  In OpenBLAS 0.2.0, level 3 BLAS is optimized on the Intel Sandy
  Bridge 64-bit OS and obtains a performance comparable with that
  Intel MKL.

  Level 3 BLAS performance was optimized on the ICT Loongson-3A CPU
  and outperforms GotoBLAS by 135% in a single thread and 120% in 4
  threads.

  Some GotoBLAS bugs have been fixed including a SEGFAULT bug on the
  new Linux kernel, MingW32/64 bugs, and a ztrmm computing error bug
  on Intel Nehalem.
