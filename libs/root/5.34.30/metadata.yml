:summary: Set of OO frameworks to handle and analyze large amounts of data efficiently
:url: https://root.cern.ch/
:description: |
  The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the
  functionality needed to handle and analyze large amounts of data in
  a very efficient way. Having the data defined as a set of objects,
  specialized storage methods are used to get direct access to the
  separate attributes of the selected objects, without having to touch
  the bulk of the data. Included are histograming methods in an
  arbitrary number of dimensions, curve fitting, function evaluation,
  minimization, graphics and visualization classes to allow the easy
  setup of an analysis system that can query and process the data
  interactively or in batch mode, as well as a general parallel
  processing framework, PROOF, that can considerably speed up an
  analysis.

  Thanks to the built-in CINT C++ interpreter the command language,
  the scripting, or macro, language and the programming language are
  all C++. The interpreter allows for fast prototyping of the macros
  since it removes the, time consuming, compile/link cycle. It also
  provides a good environment to learn C++. If more performance is
  needed the interactively developed macros can be compiled using a
  C++ compiler via a machine independent transparent compiler
  interface called ACliC.

  The system has been designed in such a way that it can query its
  databases in parallel on clusters of workstations or many-core
  machines. ROOT is an open system that can be dynamically extended by
  linking external libraries. This makes ROOT a premier platform on
  which to build data acquisition, simulation and data analysis
  systems.
