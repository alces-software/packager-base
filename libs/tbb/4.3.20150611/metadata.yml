:description: |
  Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) is a popular
  software C++ template library that simplifies the development of
  software applications running in parallel (key to any multicore
  computer). Intel(R) TBB extends C++ for parallelism in an easy to
  use and efficient manner. It is designed to work with any C++
  compiler thus simplifying development of applications for multi-core
  systems. Intel(R) TBB is a C++ template library that adds parallel
  programming for C++ programmers. It uses generic programming to be
  efficient. Threading Building Blocks includes algorithms, highly
  concurrent containers, locks and atomic operations, a task scheduler
  and a scalable memory allocator. These components in Intel(R) TBB
  can be used individually or all together to ease C++ development for
  multi-core. Intel(R) TBB provides an abstraction for parallelism
  that avoids the low level programming inherent in the direct use of
  threading packages such as p-threads or Windows threads. It has
  programmers express tasks instead of threads. Intel(R) TBB
  facilitates scalable performance in a way that works across a
  variety of machines for today, and readies programs for tomorrow. It
  detects the number of cores on the hardware platform and makes the
  necessary adjustments as more cores are added to allow software to
  adapt. Thus, Intel(R) TBB more effectively takes advantage of
  multi-core hardware. - See more at:
