  FreeTDS is a set of libraries for Unix and Linux that allows your
  programs to natively talk to Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase
  databases.

  Technically speaking, FreeTDS is an open source implementation of
  the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used by these databases for
  their own clients. It supports many different flavors of the
  protocol and three APIs to access it. Additionally FreeTDS works
  with other software such as Perl and PHP, providing access from
  those languages as well.
