:summary: Reference implementation for the C interface to the Legacy BLAS
:url: http://www.netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/
:description: |
  The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that
  provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and
  matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and
  vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector
  operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix
  operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely
  available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality
  linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.

  This package contains the reference implementation for the C
  interface to the Legacy BLAS.
