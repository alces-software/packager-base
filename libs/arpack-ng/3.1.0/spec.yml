:description: |
  ARPACK is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve
  large scale eigenvalue problems.

  Important Features:

   * Reverse Communication Interface.
   * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for
     Symmetric, Non-symmetric, Standard or Generalized Problems.
   * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for
     Standard or Generalized Problems.
   * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or Generalized Problems.
   * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition.
   * Example driver routines that may be used as templates to
     implement numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types,
     data types and precision.
   * It is free software. arpack-ng (like arpack) is released under
     the BSD 3 clauses license.
