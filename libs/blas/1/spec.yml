:description: |
  The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that
  provide standard building blocks for performing basic vector and
  matrix operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and
  vector-vector operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector
  operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix
  operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and widely
  available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality
  linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.
